Therefore, Tiyo will have $12-10=2$ $1$'s and $12-8=4$ $0$'s in his record.\n\nNow, all we have to do is figure out the order of these $1$'s and $0$'s. In every round, there are two games; the players are split into two pairs and the people in those pairs play each other. Thus, every round should have $2$ winners and $2$ losers which means that every column of the win-loss table should have $2$ $1$'s and $2$ $0$'s.

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $XY$, we have $|MP| = a$. Therefore, the triangle $MPY$ is a right triangle with legs $|MP|$ and $|PY|$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n$$|PY|^2 = |MP|^2 + |PY|^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$|PY|^2 = a^2 + |PY|^2$$\n\nSubtracting $|", "To find the minimum value of $|PQ|$, we can use the triangle inequality and the given conditions.\n\nLet $|XY| = 2a$, $|MP| = a$, and $|XQ| = 2a$. Then, $|PY| = 3a - |QY|$.\n\nBy the triangle inequality, we have $|PQ| \\ge |PY| + |QY|$.\n\nSubstituting, we get $|PQ| \\ge (3a - |QY|) + |QY| = 3a$.\n\nNow, we want to minimize $|PQ|$, which is equivalent to minimizing $3a$. Since $|XY| = 2a$, we have $\\frac{|XY|}2 < |MP| < \\frac{3|XY|}2$, so $\\frac{a}2 < a < \\frac{3a}2$.\n\nSince $a$ is positive, we can divide by $a$ to get $\\frac{1}2 < 1 < \\frac{3}2$. This implies that $a$ must be in the range $\\frac{1}2 < a < \\frac{3}2$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $|PQ| \\ge 3a$ to find the minimum value of $|PQ|$.\n\nSince $a$ is in the range $\\frac{1}2 < a < \\frac{3}2$, the minimum value of $3a$ occurs when $a = \\frac{3}2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $|PQ|$ is $3 \\cdot \\frac{3}2 = \\frac{9}2$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $\\frac{|PY|}{|QY|}$ that corresponds to this minimum value of $|PQ|$.\n\nWe have $|PY| = 3a - |QY| = 3 \\cdot \\frac{3}2 - |QY| = \\frac{9}2 - |QY|$.\n\nSince $|PQ| = \\frac{9}2$, we have $|PQ| = |PY| + |QY|$, so $\\frac{9}2 = \\frac{9}2 - |QY| + |QY|$, which implies that $|QY| = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{|PY|}{|QY|} = \\frac{\\frac{9}2}{0}$, which is undefined.\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that $|PQ| = |PY| + |QY|$ to find the value of $\\frac{|PY|}{|QY|}$ that corresponds to the minimum value of $|PQ|$.\n\nWe have $|PQ| = |PY| + |QY|$, so $\\frac{9}2 = \\frac{|PY|}{|QY|} + |QY|$.\n\nSince $|QY| = 0$, we have $\\frac{9}2 = \\frac{|PY|}{|QY|}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\frac{|PY|}{|QY|}$ that corresponds to the minimum value of $|PQ|$ is $\\frac{9}2$."]}

Find all functions $f\u00a0: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$\\[f(a^2 + b^2) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^2) = f(a)^2.\\]", "solutions": [{"title": "Solution", "content": "I claim that the only function $f$ that satisfies the constraints outlined within the problem is the function $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWe will proceed with strong induction. The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$. Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$.\n\nNow we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$, as it is either the product of two $f$-values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$-value that is equal to $1$, again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.\n\nLemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$, we then have $f(a)=1$.\n\nProof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$, or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$. Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$. Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$.\n\nNow we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$(this will always work as $p\\neq 2$(not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$, we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$, so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$. $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$. These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$, $100$, and $125$. However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$, as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$, which are both less than $p$ and are integers($p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$)). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$, we can prove something a bit more general.\n\nLemma 2: For any positive integer $n$, all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nProof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$, as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$, we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$, or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nWe can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.\n\nNow we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$, we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$, clearly less than $p$(if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$(the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$. We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$, which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$, which obviously means it must be less than $n$.

For the base case, $n = 1$, we have that $F(1,1) = 1$ and $\\frac{1+1}{1+1} = 1$, so the statement is true.\n\nNow, suppose that the statement is true for all $n \\le k$, and consider $n = k + 1$.  Let $S$ be the set $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k + 1 \\}$.  Let $T$ be the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $S$ that have a smallest member.  We can partition $T$ into two subsets: those subsets that contain $k + 1$, and those subsets that do not.\n\nLet $T_1$ be the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $S$ that contain $k + 1$.  Then the smallest member of each subset in $T_1$ is $k + 1$.  There are ${k \\choose r - 1}$ such subsets, since we are choosing $r - 1$ elements from the set $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\}$.\n\nLet $T_2$ be the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $S$ that do not contain $k + 1$.  Then the smallest member of each subset in $T_2$ is some element $i$ of $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\}$.  There are ${k \\choose r}$ such subsets, since we are choosing $r$ elements from the set $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\}$.\n\nNow, let $S'$ be the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\}$.  Then $T_2$ is the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $S'$ that have a smallest member.  By the induction hypothesis, the arithmetic mean of the smallest members of the subsets in $S'$ is $\\frac{k+1}{r+1}$.  Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the smallest members of the subsets in $T_2$ is $\\frac{k+1}{r+1} \\cdot \\frac{{k \\choose r}}{{k \\choose r}} = \\frac{k+1}{r+1}$.\n\nNow, let $S''$ be the set of all subsets of $r$ elements of $\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\} \\cup \\{ k + 1 \\}$.

The smallest number in each subset can be any of the numbers from $1$ to $n-r+1$. \n\nFor each number $k$ from $1$ to $n-r+1$, there are $\\binom{n-r+k-1}{r-1}$ subsets that contain $k$ as the smallest number.

On the other hand $\\sum_{i = 1}^n (sum(r_i) + sum(c_i)) = 2 \\sum_{i, j = 1}^n a_{ij}$, so the desired result follows.\n\nAssuming $k < n$, let $X = \\sum_{1 \\le i, j \\le k} a_{ij}$, and let\n$Y = \\sum_{i \\le k < j} a_{ij} + \\sum_{j \\le k < i} a_{ij}$, and\nlet $Z = \\sum_{k < i, j \\le n} a_{ij}$.\n\nBecause of the hypothesis applied to $a_{11}, \\dots, a_{kk}$, we\nget $2X + Y \\ge kn$.\n\nAssume we have $i \\le k < j$ and $a_{ij} = a_{ji} = 0$.  Now swap\ncolumns $i$ and $j$.  Then $a_{ij}$ becomes the new entry at $(i, i)$\nand $a_{ji}$ becomes the new entry at $(j, j)$.  It follows that we\nhave $k + 1$ zero entries on the diagonal, which contradicts the fact\nthat $k$ was maximal.  Consequently, at least one of $a_{ij}, a_{ji}$\nis non-zero, so $a_{ij} + a_{ji} \\ge 1$ for $i \\le k < j$.  It follows\nthat $Y \\ge k(n - k)$.\n\nIf we had $a_{ij} = 0$ with $i, j > k$ then again, we could swap\ncolumns $i$ and $j$.  Then $a_{ij}$ becomes the new entry at $(i, i)$,\nand again, we have a contradiction of the fact that $k$ was maximal.\nConsequently, all elements $a_{ij}$ with $i, j > k$ are non-zero.\nIt follows that $Z \\ge (n - k)^2$.\n\nTherefore, $2S = 2(X + Y + Z) \\ge (2X + Y) + Y + Z \\ge kn + k(n - k) + (n - k)^2 = n^2$.\n\nNote: Another way of finishing off the proof would be to look at\n$\\sum_{i = 1}^n (sum(r_i) + sum(c_i))$.  We know that the terms\nfor $1 = 1, \\dots, k$ are $\\ge n$ by hypothesis.  For $i > k$,\nwe know that $a_{ij} + a_{ji} \\ge 1$ for $j \\le k$, and that\n$a_{ij} \\ne 0$ for $j > k$.  It follows that\n$sum(r_i) + sum(c_i) \\ge k + 2(n - k) = 2n - k \\ge n$.\nThis is the argument solution 2 would have made in its\ncomplicated formalism, had it reached this point correctly."}], "test_result_chunked": ["We will prove the result by induction on $n$. \n\nFor $n = 1$, the result is trivial.\n\nAssume that the result holds for all $n \\leq k$, where $k \\geq 1$. \n\nNow, consider a square matrix $A = (a_{ij})(i, j = 1, 2, \\cdots, k+1)$ whose elements are non-negative integers. \n\nLet $B$ be the submatrix of $A$ obtained by removing the last row and the last column. \n\nThen, $B$ is a square matrix whose elements are non-negative integers. \n\nBy the induction hypothesis, the sum of all the elements of $B$ is $\\geq k^2 / 2$.\n\nNow, let $c_{ij}$ be the element in the last row and the last column of $A$. \n\nThen, $c_{ij} = 0$ for all $i, j \\leq k$. \n\nAlso, by the given condition, the sum of the elements in the $i$th row and the $j$th column of $A$ is $\\geq k$ for all $i, j \\leq k$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the elements in the last row and the last column of $A$ is $\\geq k^2$. \n\nHence, the sum of all the elements of $A$ is $\\geq k^2 / 2 + k^2 = (k+1)^2 / 2$, which completes the induction.\n\nTherefore, the result holds for all $n \\geq 1$.", "We prove the result by induction on $n$.

This creates a block of three boxes that do not spell SOS, and the game is now in a winning position for the second player.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step. Suppose the game is in a winning position for the first player, and the second player writes an S in the next box. We can observe that this creates a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS, and the game is now in a winning position for the second player.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the following:\n\n* If the new block of three boxes does not contain the letter S, then the first player cannot win in the next turn.\n* If the new block of three boxes contains the letter S, then the first player must have written an S in the previous box. This means that the previous block of three boxes did not contain the letter S, and therefore the first player cannot win in the previous turn.\n* Therefore, the second player can always respond to the first player's move by creating a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS, and the game is now in a winning position for the second player.\n\nThis completes the inductive step, and we have shown that if the game is in a winning position for the first player, then the second player can always respond to the first player's move by creating a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case. Suppose the game is not in a winning position for the first player, and the second player writes an S in the next box. We can observe that this creates a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS, and the game is now in a winning position for the second player.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the following:\n\n* If the new block of three boxes does not contain the letter S, then the first player cannot win in the next turn.\n* If the new block of three boxes contains the letter S, then the first player must have written an S in the previous box. This means that the previous block of three boxes did not contain the letter S, and therefore the first player cannot win in the previous turn.\n* Therefore, the second player can always respond to the first player's move by creating a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS, and the game is now in a winning position for the second player.\n\nThis completes the inductive step, and we have shown that if the game is not in a winning position for the first player, then the second player can always respond to the first player's move by creating a new block of three boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the second player has a winning strategy, and the game is always a draw if the first player does not win.", "To prove that the second player has a winning strategy, we can use a combination of induction and a clever observation.\n\nLet's define a \"good\" position as one where the second player can win, and a \"bad\" position as one where the second player cannot win.\n\nWe can start by showing that the first player can only win if the first player has a \"bad\" position.\n\nLet's consider the first player's move. If the first player writes an S in an empty square, then the second player can respond with an O in the adjacent square. This creates a \"bad\" position for the first player, since the first player cannot win.\n\nIf the first player writes an O in an empty square, then the second player can respond with an S in the adjacent square. This also creates a \"bad\" position for the first player, since the first player cannot win.\n\nTherefore, the first player can only win if the first player has a \"bad\" position.\n\nNow, let's show that the second player can always win if the first player has a \"bad\" position.\n\nWe can use induction to show that the second player can always win if the first player has a \"bad\" position.\n\nBase case: If the first player has a \"bad\" position, then the second player can win by responding to the first player's move.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the second player can win if the first player has a \"bad\" position. Now, consider a \"bad\" position where the first player has written an S in the first square, an O in the second square, and an S in the third square.\n\nThe second player can respond by writing an O in the fourth square. This creates a new \"bad\" position for the first player, since the first player cannot win.\n\nHowever, the second player can continue to respond to the first player's moves, creating a new \"bad\" position each time. This process can continue indefinitely, and the second player will always be able to respond to the first player's moves.\n\nTherefore, the second player can always win if the first player has a \"bad\" position.\n\nSince the first player can only win if the first player has a \"bad\" position, the second player can always win.\n\nTherefore, the second player has a winning strategy."]}
