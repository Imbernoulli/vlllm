The first man walks at a constant rate of 4 mph, so he will cover 4 miles in the first hour, 8 miles in the second hour, 12 miles in the third hour, and so on.\n\nThe second man walks in an arithmetic progression, starting with 2 miles in the first hour, 2.5 miles in the second hour, 3 miles in the third hour, and so on. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 0.5.\n\nLet's calculate the total distance covered by the second man in the first 8 hours:\n\n2 + 2.5 + 3 + 3.5 + 4 + 4.5 + 5 + 5.5 = 30 miles\n\nSince the two men are walking towards each other, we need to find the time it takes for the second man to cover a distance of 42 miles (72 - 30 = 42). Since the second man walks 0.5 miles more each hour, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n42 / (2 + 2.5 + 3 + 3.5 + 4 + 4.5 + 5 + 5.5) < t < 42 / (2 + 2.5 + 3 + 3.5 + 4 + 4.5 + 6 + 6.5)\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n42 / 30 < t < 42 / 42\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n1.4 < t < 1\n\nSince time cannot be negative, the only possible solution is t = 1.4 hours, which is equivalent to 1 hour and 25 minutes. However, this is not among the answer choices.\n\nLet's re-examine the situation. We can see that the second man's distance covered in the first hour is 2 miles, and the first man's distance covered in the first hour is 4 miles. The second man's distance covered in the second hour is 2.5 miles, and the first man's distance covered in the second hour is 8 miles. The difference in distance covered in the first hour is 2 miles, and the difference in distance covered in the second hour is 5.5 miles.\n\nSince the second man's distance covered in the first hour is less than the first man's distance covered in the first hour, the second man is initially closer to point M. However, the second man's distance covered in the second hour is greater than the first man's distance covered in the second hour, so the second man is now closer to point N.\n\nAs the second man continues to walk, his distance covered increases by 0.5 miles each hour, while the first man's distance covered increases by 4 miles each hour. Since the second man is initially closer to point M and the first man is initially closer to point N, the second man will eventually overtake the first man and meet him closer to point N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) nearer N than M."]}
