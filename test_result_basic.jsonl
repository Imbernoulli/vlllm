The first man walks at a constant speed of 4 mph, so he will cover a distance of 4t miles after t hours. The second man walks in an arithmetic progression, with the first term being 2 and the common difference being 1.5. So, the distance covered by the second man after t hours is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:\n\n$$\\frac{t}{2} \\left( 2 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + (2 + (t-1) \\cdot 1.5) \\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{t}{2} \\left( t + 1 \\right) \\left( 2 + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) = \\frac{7t}{4} \\left( t + 1 \\right)$$\n\nSince the two men are walking towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover is equal to the initial distance between them, which is 72 miles. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$4t + \\frac{7t}{4} \\left( t + 1 \\right) = 72$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{25t^2 + 25t - 288}{4} = 0$$\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n$$t = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{25^2 + 1152}}{10}$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{-25 \\pm 35}{10}$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{-25 + 35}{10} \\text{ or } t = \\frac{-25 - 35}{10}$$\n\n$$t = 1 \\text{ or } t = -6$$\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we discard the solution t = -6. Therefore, the two men will meet after 1 hour.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the second man is closer to M or N after 1 hour. Let's calculate the distance covered by the second man after 1 hour:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 + 2 + 3 \\right) = 3.5$$\n\nSince the first man covers a distance of 4 miles after 1 hour, the second man is closer to N than M after 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) nearer N than M."}

We may further assume that $S$ contains at most one $1$,  since any two $1$'s can be replaced by a $2$ without changing $g(S)$, but with an increase in $f(S)$.  If $S$ contains exactly one $1$, then it must also contain at least one $2$ (since $1976 \\equiv 2\\;(\\mathrm{mod }\\;3)$).

Find all functions $f\u00a0: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$\\[f(a^2 + b^2) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^2) = f(a)^2.\\]", "solutions": [{"title": "Solution", "content": "I claim that the only function $f$ that satisfies the constraints outlined within the problem is the function $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWe will proceed with strong induction. The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$. Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$.\n\nNow we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$, as it is either the product of two $f$-values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$-value that is equal to $1$, again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.\n\nLemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$, we then have $f(a)=1$.\n\nProof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$, or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$. Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$. Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$.\n\nNow we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$(this will always work as $p\\neq 2$(not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$, we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$, so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$. $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$. These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$, $100$, and $125$. However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$, as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$, which are both less than $p$ and are integers($p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$)). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$, we can prove something a bit more general.\n\nLemma 2: For any positive integer $n$, all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nProof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$, as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$, we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$, or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nWe can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.\n\nNow we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$, we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$, clearly less than $p$(if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$(the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$. We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$, which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$, which obviously means it must be less than $n$. This proves the second of our claims.\n\nThis completes the second case of the inductive step, and therefore completes both the induction and the problem.\n~Solution by hyxue"}, {"title": "Solution 2 (Taken from Twitch Solves ISL)", "content": "The Answer is $\\boxed{f\\equiv 1}$ which works but we want to prove that it's the only one.

We set it to $a=b=1$ and we get that $f(1)=f(2)=1$. Easily by Induction it shows f(n)=1. We take if $n=2k$ take $(u,v)=(k,1)$ which $2uv=n$. If $n=2k+1$, just take $(u,v)= (k+1,k)$ which $u^2-v^2=n$.

We can think of these subsets as being formed by selecting $r$ elements from the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\nFor each subset of $r$ elements, the smallest element is the first element of the subset. We can think of the smallest elements as being part of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nThe number of subsets of $r$ elements that have a smallest element $k$ is equal to the number of ways to choose the remaining $r-1$ elements from the set $\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n\\}$.

Let's denote the midpoint of the base $a$ as $A$, the midpoint of the base $c$ as $B$, and the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the base $a$ as $D$.

Therefore, $P$ can be any point on the line segment connecting the midpoints of the bases.\n\nb) To calculate the distance of $P$ from either base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again. Let's denote the distance of $P$ from base $a$ as $d_a$ and the distance of $P$ from base $c$ as $d_c$. We can write:\n\n$$d_a^2 = PD^2 + AD^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_c^2 = PD^2 + BD^2$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $AD$ and $BD$, we get:\n\n$$d_a^2 = PD^2 + \\left(\\frac{a-c}{4}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_c^2 = PD^2 + \\left(\\frac{c-a}{4}\\right)^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$d_a^2 = PD^2 + \\frac{(a-c)^2}{16} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_c^2 = PD^2 + \\frac{(c-a)^2}{16}$$\n\nSince $d_a^2$ and $d_c^2$ are both non-negative, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\n$$d_a = \\sqrt{PD^2 + \\frac{(a-c)^2}{16}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_c = \\sqrt{PD^2 + \\frac{(c-a)^2}{16}}$$\n\nc) For the points $P$ to exist, the trapezoid must be isosceles, which means that the lengths of the legs must be equal.

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute.\n3. Since the hands are together at 8 a.m., we can set up an equation to represent the situation: (30t + 0) = (6t + 0), where t is the time in hours.\n4. However, this equation doesn't make sense, because the hour hand and minute hand are not moving at the same rate. We need to use a different approach.\n5. Let's consider the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 8 a.m. and at 2 p.m. We know that the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, so in 6 hours, it moves 360 degrees. This means that the minute hand is at the 12 at 2 p.m.\n6. Now, let's consider the hour hand. In 6 hours, it moves 180 degrees (from the 8 to the 4). This means that the hour hand is at the 4 at 2 p.m.\n7. Since the hands are 180 degrees apart at 2 p.m., we can set up an equation to represent the situation: (30t + 120) = (6t + 180), where t is the time in hours.\n8. Solving for t, we get: 30t + 120 = 6t + 180\n9. 24t = 60\n10. t = 60/24\n11. t = 5/2\n12. t = 2.5 hours\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine our steps.\n\nWe know that the hands are together at 8 a.m. and 180 degrees apart at 2 p.m. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: (30t + 0) = (6t + 180), where t is the time in hours.\n\nHowever, we also know that the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute. This means that in 6 hours, it moves 360 degrees. This means that the minute hand is at the 12 at 2 p.m.\n\nNow, let's consider the hour hand. In 6 hours, it moves 180 degrees (from the 8 to the 4). This means that the hour hand is at the 4 at 2 p.m.\n\nHowever, we know that the hands are 180 degrees apart at 2 p.m. This means that the hour hand has moved 90 degrees more than the minute hand.\n\nSince the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, it moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes. This means that the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute.\n\nSince the hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, it moves 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nWe know that the hour hand has moved 90 degrees more than the minute hand. This means that the hour hand has moved 90/0.5 = 180 degrees more than the minute hand.\n\nSince the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, it moves 6 degrees per minute. This means that the minute hand has moved 180/6 = 30 minutes.\n\nSince the minute hand has moved 30 minutes, the time it takes for the hands to move from together to 180 degrees apart is 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, we know that the hands are together at 8 a.m. and 180 degrees apart at 2 p.m. This means that the trip takes 6 hours.\n\nHowever, we also know that the minute hand has moved 30 minutes. This means that the trip takes 6 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is D."}

Two players in turn write either an S or an O in an empty square. The first player who produces three consecutive boxes that spell SOS wins. If all boxes are filled without producing SOS then the game is a draw. Prove that the second player has a winning strategy.", "solutions": [{"title": "Solution", "content": "Label the squares $1$ through $2000$. The first player writes a letter in any square $k$. The second player now selects any empty square $l$ such that $\\text{min}\\,(|l-1|,|l-2000|,|l-k|) > 3$, and fills in a S. The first player may again play anywhere, say $m$. If the second player can now complete SOS, he does so; otherwise, if $l > m$ he fills an S in $l + 3$ and if $l < m$ he fills an S in $l-3$.\n\nWe thus have two Ss separated by two empty squares. Note that if any player plays any letter between the two Ss, the other player can always complete a SOS.\n\nNow the second player repeats the following algorithm:\n\nIf he can complete SOS on his turn, he does so.\nOtherwise, since there are an odd number of empty squares at the beginning of his turn, there must be either one empty square surrounded by two filled squares or one empty square surrounded by two empty squares. In both cases, the player places an O in that square. In both situations, it is easy to verify that the first player cannot win on the next turn.\n\nEventually, assuming the second player has not won yet (and since the first player does not have a winning opportunity yet), this algorithm must stop. It follows that all of the empty squares are now in pairs. Since there are an even number of empty squares, it is the first player's turn. If the first player plays on one of any pair of empty squares that does not have Ss on both its sides, then the second player plays any letter in the other square of the pair. Then, we will only have pairs of empty squares with Ss on both sides remaining (since from the first moves we have constructed at least one, and no one has played between them otherwise the game will have ended), and the first player will have to play between them, so that the second player will win."}], "test_result_basic": "To prove that the second player has a winning strategy, we can use a combination of induction and a clever observation about the game's structure.\n\nLet's define a \"winning position\" as a position where the first player has three consecutive boxes that spell SOS. We can also define a \"block\" as a sequence of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the base case: the first row. If the first player writes an S in the first column, the second player can write an O in the second column, and the first player is forced to write an S in the third column. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step. Suppose that the first player has not won and the second player has not blocked a winning position. We can assume that the second player has not written an O in the first column of the first row. If the first player writes an S in the first column of the second row, the second player can write an O in the second column of the second row. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, consider the first column of the third row. If the first player writes an S in the first column of the third row, the second player can write an O in the second column of the third row. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNotice that the first player has not created a winning position, and the second player has created a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS. This means that the second player has forced the first player into a losing position.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the second player has a winning strategy.\n\nTo see why this strategy works, consider the following. If the second player creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS, the first player is forced to create a winning position. But if the first player creates a winning position, the second player can simply block it by writing an O in the first column of the row below.\n\nTherefore, the second player can always force the first player into a losing position, and the game is won by the second player.\n\nThis strategy works because it takes advantage of the fact that the game is played on a grid, and the first player's winning position is limited to a single row. By creating blocks of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS, the second player can force the first player into a losing position, and the game is won by the second player."}
