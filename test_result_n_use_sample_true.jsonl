If $t$ is not an integer, then we should have a good enough approximation to choose an answer choice (given the relatively large distance of $72$ miles compared to their speeds).

The first man walks at a constant rate of 4 mph, so he will cover 4 miles in the first hour, 8 miles in the second hour, 12 miles in the third hour, and so on.\n\nThe second man walks in an arithmetic progression, starting with 2 miles in the first hour, 2.5 miles in the second hour, 3 miles in the third hour, and so on.

Let's assume they meet after x hours.\n\nThe first man will cover a distance of 4x miles in x hours.\n\nThe second man will cover a distance of 30 + 0.5x miles in x hours.\n\nSince they are walking towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should be equal to the initial distance between them, which is 72 miles.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n4x + 30 + 0.5x = 72\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4.5x + 30 = 72\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n4.5x = 42\n\nDivide both sides by 4.5:\n\nx = 9.33 hours\n\nSince x is greater than 8 hours, the men will meet after 9.33 hours, which is closer to 9 hours than 8 hours.
