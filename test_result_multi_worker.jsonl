Find all functions $f\u00a0: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$\\[f(a^2 + b^2) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^2) = f(a)^2.\\]", "solutions": [{"title": "Solution", "content": "I claim that the only function $f$ that satisfies the constraints outlined within the problem is the function $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWe will proceed with strong induction. The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$. Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$.\n\nNow we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$, as it is either the product of two $f$-values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$-value that is equal to $1$, again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.\n\nLemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$, we then have $f(a)=1$.\n\nProof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$, or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$. Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$. Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$.\n\nNow we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$(this will always work as $p\\neq 2$(not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$, we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$, so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$. $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$. These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$, $100$, and $125$. However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$, as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$, which are both less than $p$ and are integers($p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$)). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$, we can prove something a bit more general.\n\nLemma 2: For any positive integer $n$, all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nProof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$, as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$, we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$, or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nWe can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.\n\nNow we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$, we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$, clearly less than $p$(if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$(the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$. We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$, which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$, which obviously means it must be less than $n$. This proves the second of our claims.\n\nThis completes the second case of the inductive step, and therefore completes both the induction and the problem.\n~Solution by hyxue"}, {"title": "Solution 2 (Taken from Twitch Solves ISL)", "content": "The Answer is $\\boxed{f\\equiv 1}$ which works but we want to prove that it's the only one. Claim: If $f(a)=f(b)=1$ and $a>b$, then $f(a^2-b^2)= f(2ab)= 1$. Proof: We can write $1=f(a)=f(b)= f(a^2+b^2)= \\sqrt{f((a^2+b^2)^2)} = \\sqrt{f((a^2-b^2)^2+ (2ab)^2)} = \\sqrt{f(a^2-b^2)f(2ab)}$. We set it to $a=b=1$ and we get that $f(1)=f(2)=1$. Easily by Induction it shows f(n)=1. We take if $n=2k$ take $(u,v)=(k,1)$ which $2uv=n$. If $n=2k+1$, just take $(u,v)= (k+1,k)$ which $u^2-v^2=n$.

The smallest element of $\\{1\\}$ is $1$ and the smallest element of $\\emptyset$ is undefined, so we can't use this to compute the arithmetic mean.  However, we can still compute the arithmetic mean of the smallest elements of all subsets of $r$ elements of the set $\\{1\\}$.

But this is impossible, since the smallest element of any subset of $r$ elements of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$ is at most $k$.\n\nNow consider the subsets of $r$ elements of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$.

But this is impossible, since the smallest element of any subset of $r$ elements of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$ is at most $k$.\n\nNow consider the subsets of $r$ elements of the set $\\{k + 1\\}$.

Each of these subsets has a smallest member.  Let $T$ be the set of these smallest numbers.

We can write $F(k+1,k+1)$ as the sum of the smallest numbers of all subsets of $k+1$ elements, divided by the number of subsets of $k+1$ elements.\n\nThe number of subsets of $k+1$ elements is $\\binom{k+1}{k+1} = 1$.  The smallest number of each subset is either $k+1$ or some number between $1$ and $k$.  There is exactly one subset with the smallest number $k+1$, and the rest of the subsets have smallest numbers between $1$ and $k$.\n\nThe sum of the smallest numbers of all subsets of $k+1$ elements is equal to the sum of the smallest numbers of all subsets of $k$ elements, plus $k+1$.  This is because the smallest number of each subset of $k+1$ elements is either the smallest number of a subset of $k$ elements, or $k+1$.\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$$F(k+1,k+1) = \\frac{\\text{sum of smallest numbers of all subsets of } k+1 \\text{ elements}}{1}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{\\text{sum of smallest numbers of all subsets of } k \\text{ elements} + (k+1)}{1}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{\\text{sum of smallest numbers of all subsets of } k \\text{ elements}}{1} + (k+1)$$\n\n$$= F(k,k) + (k+1).$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $F(k,k) = \\frac{k+1}{k+1}$.

For $r=1$, the smallest element of every subset is the smallest element of the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$, so $F(n,1)=n$, and the formula holds.\n\nNow suppose that the formula holds for $r-1$.

The smallest element of each subset is $i$, and the smallest element of every subset of $r-1$ elements is the smallest element of the corresponding subset of $r$ elements minus one.

We claim that\n\n$$\\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{a \\in A} x_a = \\frac{k + 1}{r + 1}.$$\n\nTo prove this, we note that for each subset $t \\in T$, there is a corresponding subset $a \\in A$ such that $t$ is obtained by adding $k + 1$ to $a$.  The smallest element of $t$ is equal to the smallest element of $a$ plus $k + 1$.

Since each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants, we can think of each pair as a \"shared problem\" between two contestants.\n\nLet's count the number of shared problems. Since there are $28$ problems in total, there are ${28 \\choose 2} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 27}{2} = 378$ pairs of problems.\n\nSince each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants, the total number of shared problems is equal to the number of pairs of problems, which is $378$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems.

This means that the number of contestants who solved each problem is not equal to $7$.\n\nTherefore, there must be a contestant who solved either no problems or at least four problems in Part I.\n\nThis is because if a contestant solved exactly $3$ problems, then the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems would be $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, which is less than $756$. Similarly, if a contestant solved exactly $4$ problems, then the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems would be $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$, which is still less than $756$. However, if a contestant solved exactly $5$ problems, then the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems would be $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$, which is still less than $756$.

But if a contestant solved exactly $7$ problems, then the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems would be $7 \\cdot 2 = 14$, which is still less than $756$. However, if a contestant solved exactly $8$ problems, then the number of contestants who solved each pair of problems would be $8 \\cdot 2 = 16$, which is still less than $756$.

This means that the number of pairs of problems solved by a contestant is equal to the number of pairs of problems solved by the other contestant. Since there are $28$ problems, the number of pairs of problems is ${28 \\choose 2} = 378$.\n\nLet's consider the number of pairs of problems solved by a contestant in Part I. This number is ${x \\choose 2}$. Since each pair of problems is also solved by another contestant, we have ${x \\choose 2} = 378 - {y \\choose 2}$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $x(x-1)/2 = 378 - y(y-1)/2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems solved by a contestant in Part II.

Since each pair of problems is also solved by another contestant, we have ${y \\choose 2} = 378 - {x \\choose 2}$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $y(y-1)/2 = 378 - x(x-1)/2$.\n\nNow, let's add the two equations:\n\n$x(x-1)/2 + y(y-1)/2 = 378 - 378$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $x^2 - x + y^2 - y = 0$.\n\nRearranging this equation, we get $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nThis equation represents a circle centered at $(1/2, 1/2)$ with radius $1/2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, we have $x \\geq 1$ and $y \\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $x$ and $y$. Since $x^2 - x + y^2 - y = 0$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - x - y = 0$.\n\nRearranging this equation, we get $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, we have $(x-1/2)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(y-1/2)^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nThis means that $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nSince $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, we have $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 \\leq 1/4$.\n\nThis means that $0 \\leq (x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 \\leq 1/4$.\n\nSince $(x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2$ is a sum of two squares, we have $0 \\leq (x-1/2)^2 + (y-1/2)^2 \\leq 1$.\n\nThis means that $0 \\leq x-1/2 \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y-1/2 \\leq 1$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, we have $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nHowever, we know that $x \\geq 1$ and $y \\geq 1$. This means that $x = 1$ and $y = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems solved by a contestant in Part I. This number is ${x \\choose 2} = {1 \\choose 2} = 0$.\n\nThis means that a contestant solved no problems in Part I.\n\nHowever, we know that each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether. This means that a contestant solved $7$ problems in Part II.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems solved by a contestant in Part II. This number is ${y \\choose 2} = {7 \\choose 2} = 21$.\n\nThis means", "Let's denote the number of problems solved by contestant $i$ in Part I as $x_i$ and in Part II as $y_i$. We are given that $x_i + y_i = 7$ for each contestant $i$.\n\nWe also know that each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants. Let's denote the number of pairs of problems that were solved by contestant $i$ as $p_i$. Then, we have $p_i = \\binom{x_i}{2} + \\binom{y_i}{2} = \\frac{x_i(x_i-1)}{2} + \\frac{y_i(y_i-1)}{2}$.\n\nSince each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants, the total number of pairs of problems solved by all contestants is equal to the total number of pairs of problems, which is $\\binom{28}{2} = 378$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 378.$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p_i$, we get\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i(x_i-1)}{2} + \\frac{y_i(y_i-1)}{2} = 378.$$\n\nSince $x_i + y_i = 7$ for each contestant $i$, we have $y_i = 7 - x_i$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i(x_i-1)}{2} + \\frac{(7-x_i)(6-x_i)}{2} = 378.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - x_i + 21 = 756.$$\n\nSince $x_i + y_i = 7$ for each contestant $i$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = 14$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 14x_i + 21 = 756 - 196 = 560.$$\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to get\n\n$$(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 14x_i + 21)^2 \\leq (n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - 14n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + n \\sum_{i=1}^n 1)^2.$$\n\nSimplifying, we get\n\n$$(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 14x_i + 21)^2 \\leq (n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - 14n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + n)^2.$$\n\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 14x_i + 21 = 560$, we have\n\n$$560^2 \\leq (n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - 14n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + n)^2.$$\n\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 14$, we have\n\n$$560^2 \\leq (n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + 14n - 14n + n)^2 = n^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n^2.$$\n\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\geq \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}{n}$, we have\n\n$$560^2 \\leq n^2 \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}{n} + n^2 = n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n^2.$$\n\nSince $n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n^2 \\geq 2n \\sqrt{n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$, we have\n\n$$560^2 \\leq 2n \\sqrt{n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} + n^2.$$\n\nSince $n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + n^2 \\geq 2n \\sqrt{n \\sum_{i=", "Let's consider the following:\n\n- Let $x$ be the number of problems solved by a contestant in Part I.\n- Let $y$ be the number of problems solved by a contestant in Part II.\n- Let $z$ be the number of problems solved by a contestant in both Part I and Part II.\n\nSince each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether, we have $x + y - 2z = 7$.\n\nSince each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants, we have $x(x-1)/2 + y(y-1)/2 = 28$.\n\nWe can rewrite the second equation as $x^2 - x + y^2 - y = 56$.\n\nNow, let's consider the following cases:\n\n- Case 1: $x \\leq 3$.

Then, we can do a simple coordinate bash. Let $B$ be at $(0,0)$, $A$ be at $(3,3\\sqrt{3})$, and $C$ be at $(6,0)$. We then create a new point $O$ at the center of everything. It should be noted because of similarity between $\\triangle N_{1}N_{2}N_{3}$ and $\\triangle ABC$, we can find the scale factor between the two triangle by simply dividing $N_{2}O$(not nitrous oxide) by $AO$. First, we need to find the coordinates of $O$ and $N_{2}$. $O$ is easily found at $(3,\\sqrt{3})$ and $N_{2}$ be found by calculating equation of $BE$ and $AD$.$E$ is located $(4,2\\sqrt{3})$ so $BE$ is $y=\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. $D$ be at $(4,0)$ and the slope is $-3\\sqrt{3}$. We see that they be at the same $x$-value. Quick maths calculate the x value to be $4-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ which be $3\\frac{3}{7}$. Another quick maths caculation of the $y$-value lead it be equal $2\\sqrt{3}*\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+3\\sqrt{3}}$ which be $1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3}$. Peferct, so now $N_{2}$ be at $(3\\frac{3}{7},1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$. Subtracting this coordinate with the coordinates of the center $O$ give you $(\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$. Pythagorean theorem on that gives $\\frac{\\sqrt{84}}{7}$ which simplifies to $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}.$ $A$ is vertically above $O$ by $2\\sqrt{3}$ units. The scale factor is thus $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$ giving us an answer of: ~Lopkiloinm \\[\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{7}[ABC]}\\] (Note: the presence of $7$ in the denominator gives hints on the answer, so when you see it, 1/7 looks like the obvious choice) \\[\\]\n(Another note: the question gives you the ratio of $3:3:1$ so I did not need to use that many steps to calculate the coordinate of $N_2$, directly attaining it to be at $(3\\frac{3}{7},1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$ After realizing this, this method should actually be pretty quick, may even be quicker than the non coordinate method. Regardless, if you don't get the ratio and you encounter a problem similar to this, the coordinate bash with all these calculations should get you the correct answer. Also, there is an even bashier way using all the points and shoelace formula.

Since PQ is the altitude, it is perpendicular to the base a, and QM is half the length of the base a.\n\nSimilarly, we can draw a right triangle PNM with legs PN and QM, and hypotenuse PM.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in triangle PQM, we get:\n\nx^2 = PQ^2 + QM^2\n\nSince PQ is the altitude, it is equal to the altitude h of the trapezoid. We also know that QM is half the length of the base a, so QM = a/2.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\nx^2 = h^2 + (a/2)^2\n\nx^2 = h^2 + a^2/4\n\nx = sqrt(h^2 + a^2/4)\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle PNM. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\nx^2 = PN^2 + QM^2\n\nWe know that PN is half the length of the base c, so PN = c/2.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nx^2 = (c/2)^2 + (a/2)^2\n\nx^2 = c^2/4 + a^2/4\n\nx = sqrt(c^2/4 + a^2/4)\n\nSince both legs subtend right angles at P, we can equate the two expressions for x:\n\nsqrt(h^2 + a^2/4) = sqrt(c^2/4 + a^2/4)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nh^2 + a^2/4 = c^2/4 + a^2/4\n\nSubtracting a^2/4 from both sides, we get:\n\nh^2 = c^2/4\n\nh = c/2\n\nThis means that the altitude h is half the length of the base c.\n\nb) To calculate the distance of P from either base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle PQM:\n\nPQ^2 = PM^2 - QM^2\n\nWe know that PM is the length of the leg, which is x. We also know that QM is half the length of the base a, so QM = a/2.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nPQ^2 = x^2 - (a/2)^2\n\nPQ^2 = (h^2 + a^2/4) - (a/2)^2\n\nPQ^2 = h^2 + a^2/4 - a^2/4\n\nPQ^2 = h^2\n\nPQ = sqrt(h^2)\n\nPQ = h\n\nThis means that the distance of P from either base is equal to the altitude h.\n\nc) To determine under what conditions such points P actually exist, we need to consider the cases where the trapezoid is valid.\n\nOne condition is that the trapezoid must have a non-zero altitude. This means that the bases a and c must be of different lengths.\n\nAnother condition is that the trapezoid must have a non-zero length for the legs. This means that the bases a and c must be of different lengths, and the altitude h must be non-zero.\n\nIf the trapezoid is degenerate (i.e., it has zero length for the legs), then the points P do not exist.\n\nIn summary, the points P such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P exist when the trapezoid has a non-zero altitude and non-zero length for the legs, and the bases a and c are of different lengths. The distance of P from either base is equal to the altitude h.", "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into three parts as requested.\n\na) Finding all points P such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P:\n\nLet's consider the right triangles formed by the legs of the trapezoid and the line segment connecting the midpoint of the legs to point P. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs have the same length, say 'b'. The altitude of the trapezoid is 'h'. \n\nLet's denote the distance from the midpoint of the legs to point P as 'x'. Then, we can form two right triangles with legs 'b' and 'x', and hypotenuse 'b + x' (for the triangle formed by the shorter leg and the line segment connecting the midpoint of the legs to point P) and 'b - x' (for the triangle formed by the longer leg and the line segment connecting the midpoint of the legs to point P).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n(b + x)^2 = b^2 + x^2\n(b - x)^2 = b^2 + x^2\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\nb^2 + 2bx + x^2 = b^2 + x^2\nb^2 - 2bx + x^2 = b^2 + x^2\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n2bx = 0\n-2bx = 0\n\nThis implies that either x = 0 or b = 0. Since b is the length of the leg, it cannot be zero. Therefore, x = 0.\n\nHowever, this solution does not make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that point P is at the midpoint of the legs, which is not the only possible solution.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. We can also consider the right triangles formed by the altitude of the trapezoid and the line segment connecting point P to the bases of the trapezoid.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nh^2 + (a/2)^2 = b^2\nh^2 + (c/2)^2 = b^2\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\na^2 + h^2 = 4b^2\nc^2 + h^2 = 4b^2\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\nc^2 - a^2 = 0\n\nThis implies that either c = a or c = -a. Since c is the length of the base, it cannot be negative. Therefore, c = a.\n\nNow, we can substitute c = a into one of the original equations to get:\n\na^2 + h^2 = 4b^2\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with center (0, h) and radius b.\n\nTherefore, the points P such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P are the points on the circle.\n\nb) Calculating the distance of P from either base:\n\nThe distance of point P from the shorter base is the distance from the center of the circle to the shorter base minus the radius of the circle. This is equal to h - b.\n\nThe distance of point P from the longer base is the distance from the center of the circle to the longer base plus the radius of the circle. This is equal to h + b.\n\nc) Determining under what conditions such points P actually exist:\n\nThe points P exist if and only if the circle intersects the bases of the trapezoid. This occurs if and only if the distance between the centers of the two bases is less than or equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\nThe distance between the centers of the two bases is equal to the difference between the lengths of the bases, which is |a - c|.\n\nThe diameter of the circle is equal to 2b.\n\nTherefore, the points P exist if and only if |a - c| \u2264 2b.\n\nIn the case where c = a, the condition simplifies to |a - a| \u2264 2b, which is always true.\n\nIn the case where c \u2260 a, the condition simplifies to |a - c| \u2264 2b. This is true if and only if a and c are within a distance of 2b from each other.\n\nTherefore, the points P exist if and only if the bases of the trapezoid are within a distance of 2b from each other.", "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into three parts as requested.\n\na) Finding all points P such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P:\n\nLet's consider the right triangles formed by the legs of the trapezoid and the line segment from the midpoint of the shorter base to point P. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two right triangles are congruent. \n\nLet's denote the midpoint of the shorter base as M. The line segment from M to P is perpendicular to the bases of the trapezoid. \n\nNow, consider the right triangle formed by the longer base, the altitude, and the line segment from the midpoint of the longer base to point P. This triangle is also a right triangle.\n\nSince the two right triangles are congruent, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(a/2)^2 + h^2 = (c/2)^2 + (h/2)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\na^2 + 4h^2 = c^2 + h^2\n\na^2 = c^2 - 3h^2\n\nThis equation represents a hyperbola in the a-h plane.\n\nb) Calculating the distance of P from either base:\n\nThe distance of P from the shorter base is the length of the line segment from M to P, which is equal to the altitude h.\n\nThe distance of P from the longer base is the length of the line segment from the midpoint of the longer base to P, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd^2 = (c/2)^2 + (h/2)^2\n\nd = sqrt((c/2)^2 + (h/2)^2)\n\nc) Determining under what conditions such points P actually exist:\n\nFor points P to exist, the equation a^2 = c^2 - 3h^2 must have real solutions. This is true when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative:\n\n4h^2 - 4(c^2 - a^2) >= 0\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\nh^2 >= c^2 - a^2\n\nThis inequality represents a region in the a-h plane.\n\nDiscussion of various cases:\n\n- If h^2 = c^2 - a^2, then the points P are the vertices of the trapezoid.\n- If h^2 > c^2 - a^2, then the points P are inside the trapezoid.\n- If h^2 < c^2 - a^2, then the points P are outside the trapezoid.\n- If h = 0, then the trapezoid degenerates into a line segment, and points P do not exist.\n- If a = c, then the trapezoid degenerates into a parallelogram, and points P do not exist.\n\nIn summary, points P exist when the inequality h^2 >= c^2 - a^2 is satisfied, and the distance of P from either base can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.", "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\na) To find the points $P$ such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at $P$, we need to consider the geometry of the trapezoid. Let's denote the midpoint of the base $a$ as $A$, the midpoint of the base $c$ as $B$, and the foot of the altitude as $D$. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs $AD$ and $BD$ are congruent.\n\nNow, let's consider a point $P$ on the axis of symmetry. We can draw a perpendicular line from $P$ to the base $a$ and denote the foot of this perpendicular line as $E$. Since the legs subtend right angles at $P$, $\\angle AEP$ and $\\angle BED$ are right angles.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $AEP$, we have:\n\n$$AE^2 + EP^2 = AP^2$$\n\nSimilarly, in triangle $BED$, we have:\n\n$$BE^2 + EP^2 = BP^2$$\n\nSince $AE = BE$ (because $A$ and $B$ are midpoints of the bases), we can equate the two equations:\n\n$$AE^2 + EP^2 = BE^2 + EP^2$$\n\nSubtracting $EP^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$AE^2 = BE^2$$\n\nSince $AE = BE$, we have:\n\n$$AE = BE$$\n\nThis means that $P$ is equidistant from the midpoints $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $P$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$.\n\nb) To calculate the distance of $P$ from either base, we need to find the length of $EP$ or $BP$. Since $P$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $AEP$ or $BED$ to find $EP$ or $BP$.\n\nLet's use triangle $AEP$. We have:\n\n$$EP^2 = AP^2 - AE^2$$\n\nSince $AP$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle $AEP$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write:\n\n$$AP^2 = AE^2 + EP^2$$\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n$$EP^2 = AE^2 + EP^2 - AE^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$EP^2 = 0$$\n\nThis means that $EP = 0$, and therefore, $P$ lies on the base $a$.\n\nSimilarly, using triangle $BED$, we can show that $BP = 0$, and therefore, $P$ lies on the base $c$.\n\nc) For points $P$ to exist, the trapezoid must be non-degenerate, meaning that the bases $a$ and $c$ must not be parallel. If the bases are parallel, the trapezoid degenerates into a pair of parallel lines, and there are no points $P$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\nAdditionally, if the bases $a$ and $c$ are equal, the trapezoid degenerates into a parallelogram, and there is only one point $P$ that satisfies the conditions, which is the midpoint of the bases.\n\nIn summary, points $P$ exist if and only if the trapezoid is non-degenerate and the bases $a$ and $c$ are not equal."]}

At 8 a.m., the hour hand is at the 8 and the minute hand is at the 12. The angle between them is 0 degrees.\n2. As the hour hand moves, it covers 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it covers 30 degrees per hour.\n3. The minute hand covers 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it covers 6 degrees per minute.\n4. Since the hands are together at 8 a.m., we need to find the time it takes for the minute hand to cover 180 degrees (the angle between the hands when they are 180 degrees apart).\n5. The minute hand covers 6 degrees per minute, so it will take 180/6 = 30 minutes for the minute hand to cover 180 degrees.\n6.

The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, so it moves 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nAt 8 a.m., the hour hand is at the 8, which is 240 degrees from the 12. The minute hand is at the 12, which is 0 degrees from the 12.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 8 a.m. is 240 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, so it will move 6 * 6 = 36 degrees per hour.\n\nThe hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute, so it will move 0.5 * 60 = 30 degrees per hour.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand decreases by 6 degrees per hour and 30 degrees per hour, so the angle decreases by 36 degrees per hour.\n\nSince the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is 180 degrees when Henry arrives at his destination, we can set up the equation:\n\n240 - 36t = 180\n\nwhere t is the number of hours after 8 a.m.\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 4\n\nSo, the hour hand and the minute hand are together 4 hours after 8 a.m.\n\nNow, let's find the time when the hour hand and the minute hand are 180 degrees apart. \n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand increases by 36 degrees per hour and 30 degrees per hour, so the angle increases by 66 degrees per hour.\n\nSince the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is 180 degrees when Henry arrives at his destination, we can set up the equation:\n\n240 + 66t = 180\n\nwhere t is the number of hours after 8 a.m.\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = -12\n\nSince t cannot be negative, we need to add 12 hours to 8 a.m. to get the correct time.\n\nThe correct time is 8 a.m. + 12 hours = 8 p.m.\n\nHowever, the problem states that Henry arrives at his destination between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., so we need to subtract 12 hours from 8 p.m.\n\nThe correct time is 8 p.m. - 12 hours = 8 a.m. (this is before 8 a.m.)\n\nWe need to add 12 hours to 8 a.m. to get the correct time.\n\nThe correct time is 8 a.m. + 12 hours = 8 p.m.\n\nHowever, the problem states that Henry arrives at his destination between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., so we need to subtract 6 hours from 8 p.m.\n\nThe correct time is 8 p.m. - 6 hours = 2 p.m.\n\nNow, let's find the time difference between when the hands of the clock are together and when they are 180 degrees apart.\n\nThe hour hand and the minute hand are together 4 hours after 8 a.m., which is 12 p.m.\n\nThe hour hand and the minute hand are 180 degrees apart 6 hours after 8 a.m., which is 2 p.m.\n\nThe time difference is 2 p.m. - 12 p.m. = 2 hours.\n\nHowever, we need to add the time it takes for the minute hand to move from 12 to 2 p.m.\n\nThe minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, so it will move 6 * 30 = 180 degrees in 30 minutes.\n\nSince the minute hand moves 180 degrees in 30 minutes, it will move 180 degrees in 30 minutes.\n\nThe time it takes for the minute hand to move from 12 to 2 p.m. is 30 minutes.\n\nThe total time is 2 hours + 30 minutes = 2 hours 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, we need to convert the minutes to hours and minutes.\n\n30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours.\n\nThe total time is 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n\nHowever, we need to convert the decimal hours to hours and minutes.\n\n0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes.\n\nThe total time is 2 hours 30 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{6 hr. 43-7/11 min.}}$", "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the hands of the clock to move from together to 180 degrees apart.\n\nLet's break down the movement of the clock hands:\n\n1.

Within each part, we can choose three points of the same color. Since the arcs are equal, the distance between any two points of the same color is the same. Therefore, the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.\n\nThis approach works because the equal arcs ensure that the distance between any two points of the same color is the same, which is a necessary condition for the triangles to be congruent.", "To prove that one can choose three points of each color in such a way that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent, we will use a constructive approach.\n\nLet's consider the points of each color as a set of 108 points. We will choose three points from each set, and we will show that the four triangles formed by these points are congruent.\n\nFirst, we will choose three points from the Red set. Since there are 108 points in the Red set, we can choose three points in $\\binom{108}{3}$ ways. However, we don't need to calculate the exact number of ways to choose these points.

We will show that the four triangles formed by these points are congruent.\n\nSince the points are colored Red, we know that the distance between any two points of the same color is the same. Let's call this distance $d$. We can use this fact to show that the four triangles are congruent.\n\nConsider the triangle formed by $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.

This means that the triangle is equilateral.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle formed by $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_4$. Since the points are colored Red, we know that the distance between $R_1$ and $R_4$ is $d$, and the distance between $R_2$ and $R_4$ is also $d$. This means that the triangle is isosceles.\n\nHowever, we know that the triangle is equilateral, so it must be that the distance between $R_1$ and $R_4$ is equal to the distance between $R_2$ and $R_4$. This means that $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_4$ are collinear.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that $R_1$, $R_3$, and $R_5$ are collinear, and $R_2$, $R_3$, and $R_6$ are collinear.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle formed by $R_1$, $R_5$, and $R_6$. Since $R_1$, $R_5$, and $R_6$ are collinear, we know that the distance between $R_1$ and $R_5$ is equal to the distance between $R_1$ and $R_6$, and the distance between $R_5$ and $R_6$ is equal to the distance between $R_1$ and $R_6$. This means that the triangle is isosceles.\n\nHowever, we know that the triangle is equilateral, so it must be that the distance between $R_1$ and $R_5$ is equal to the distance between $R_1$ and $R_6$.

This gives us a speed of $\\frac{11r}{5280}$ feet per second.\n\nWe also know that the time for a complete rotation of the wheel is shortened by $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a second.  Since the circumference of the wheel is $11$ feet, the time for a complete rotation is $\\frac{11}{\\frac{11r}{5280}} = \\frac{5280}{r}$ seconds.

Since the equation $2x + 3y = 763$ has a solution $(x, y) = (381, 1)$, we can add $3$ to $x$ and subtract $2$ from $y$ to get another solution $(x, y) = (384, -1)$. However, this solution is not in positive integers, so we must subtract $1$ from $x$ and add $2$ to $y$ to get another solution $(x, y) = (383, 0)$. We can continue this process to find all solutions in positive integers.\n\nSince we can add $3$ to $x$ and subtract $2$ from $y$ to get another solution, and we start with the solution $(x, y) = (381, 1)$, we can find $254$ solutions in positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 254}$", "To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the number of solutions to a linear Diophantine equation of the form $ax + by = c$ is equal to the number of solutions to the equation $ax + by = c + kn$, where $n$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ and $k$ is any integer.\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 763$. The greatest common divisor of $2$ and $3$ is $1$, so we can write the equation as $2x + 3y = 763 + 1k$.\n\nSince $763 + 1k$ is an odd number, we know that $k$ must be even. Let $k = 2m$, where $m$ is an integer. Then we have $2x + 3y = 763 + 2m$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as $2x + 3y - 763 = 2m$. Since $2$ and $3$ are relatively prime, we know that the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by $2$ if and only if $x$ is even. Similarly, the left-hand side is divisible by $3$ if and only if $y$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nSince $763$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, we know that the left-hand side of the equation is not divisible by $2$ or $3$ unless $x$ is even and $y$ is a multiple of $3$.

Since $x$ and $y$ must be positive, we have $381 + 2k > 0$ and $253 + 3k > 0$, which implies that $k > -190.5$ and $k > -84.33$, respectively.

To see this, consider a board position in $B_n$. If the first player has not won, then they must have not played SOS. Therefore, the last move must have been either an S or an O. If the last move was an S, then the second player can play O to ensure that the first player cannot win in the next move. If the last move was an O, then the second player can play S to ensure that the first player cannot win in the next move.\n\nNow, let's show that $B_n \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $n$. We can do this by induction on $n$. For $n = 0$, the board is empty, so $B_0$ is not empty. Suppose that $B_k \\neq \\emptyset$ for some $k \\geq 0$.

Then, by the previous observation, $B_{k+1} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nNow, let's show that $B_n$ is finite for all $n$. We can do this by induction on $n$. For $n = 0$, the board is empty, so $B_0$ is finite. Suppose that $B_k$ is finite for some $k \\geq 0$. Then, by the previous observation, $B_{k+1}$ is finite.\n\nNow, let's show that $B_n$ is bounded for all $n$. We can do this by induction on $n$. For $n = 0$, the board is empty, so $B_0$ is bounded. Suppose that $B_k$ is bounded for some $k \\geq 0$. Then, by the previous observation, $B_{k+1}$ is bounded.\n\nNow, let's show that $B_n$ is a finite, bounded, and closed set for all $n$. We can do this by induction on $n$. For $n = 0$, we have already shown that $B_0$ is finite, bounded, and closed. Suppose that $B_k$ is finite, bounded, and closed for some $k \\geq 0$.

We can also define a \"block\" as a sequence of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the base case: the first row. If the first player writes an S in the first box, the second player can write an O in the second box, and the first player is forced to write an S in the third box. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step. Suppose we have a winning position in the first row, and we want to show that the second player can win in the next row. We can assume that the first player has written an S in the first box of the first row, and the second player has written an O in the second box of the first row.\n\nIn the second row, the first player can write an S in the first box, and the second player can write an O in the second box. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the third box of the second row. If the first player writes an S in this box, the second player can write an O in the fourth box, and the first player is forced to write an S in the fifth box. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nHowever, if the first player writes an O in the third box, the second player can write an S in the fourth box, and the first player is forced to write an O in the fifth box. This creates a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS.\n\nIn both cases, the second player has created a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS, and the first player is forced to create another block. This means that the second player can continue to create blocks, and eventually, the first player will be forced to create a block that spells SOS.\n\nTherefore, the second player has a winning strategy.\n\nThis proof can be generalized to the entire grid. The key idea is that the second player can always create a block of three consecutive boxes that do not spell SOS, and then force the first player to create another block. This process can be repeated until the first player is forced to create a block that spells SOS.\n\nThis proof shows that the second player has a winning strategy, and it can be used to prove that the second player can win in any position on the grid."]}

That is, diagonal $(0,0,-k) \\rightarrow (k,k,k)$ does not have a parallel line and neither do the other three.\n\nBy doing a reflection of the points on the $x=k$ plane along the $yz$-plane these new four diagonals will have their respective parallel diagonals on the $x \\le 0$ space.\n\nBut now we have four more diagonals on the set of 4 cubes that do not have a parallel line.  That is, diagonal $(-k,0,-k) \\rightarrow (k,k,k)$ does not have a parallel line and neither do the other three.\n\nBy doing a reflection of the points on the $y=k$ plane along the $xz$-plane these new four diagonals will have their respective parallel diagonals on the $y \\le 0$ space.\n\nThe new 4 longer diagonals will cross the diagonal of two of the cubes and will have a parallel line on one of the other cubes.\n\nSo, we found a set at least one finite set $M$ that we can define as $M=\\{(x,y,z)\\}$ where $x,y,z \\in \\{-k,0,k\\}$ giving a total of 27 points.  Therefore such a set exists.\n\nAnother way to define this set of points is let $M$ be:\n\nLet $V$ be a solid cube or right angled parallelepiped\n\nLet $M_{v}$ be the set of all 8 vertices of $V$\n\nLet $M_{me}$ be the set of all 12 midpoints of the edges of $V$\n\nLet $M_{mf}$ be the set of all 6 midpoints of the faces of $V$\n\nLet $M_{c}$ be the center of $V$\n\n$M$=$M_{v} \\cup M_{me} \\cup M_{mf} \\cup M_{c}$\n\nIt is possible that one can construct many other sets of $M$ using regular tetrahedrons with some reflections and with less points than 27, or by translating or rotating or skewing all the the points simultaneously of the finite set $M$ that we defined here.  But that is not necessary for this problem because it asks to prove whether there exist a set with the described conditions.  By showing that at least one set exists with those conditions, the problem is proved.\n\n$IMO 1973 P2 01.png$\n\n~Tomas Diaz.  orders@tomasdiaz.com\n\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.
