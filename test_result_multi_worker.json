If $t$ is not an integer, then we should have a good enough approximation to choose an answer choice (given the relatively large distance of $72$ miles compared to their speeds).

Therefore, $16m^4 \\equiv -8k^4 \\pmod{z}$.\n\nDividing both sides by $8$, we get $2m^4 \\equiv -k^4 \\pmod{z}$. Since $z$ is prime, we have $\\gcd(2m^4, z) = 1$.\n\nSince $2m^4$ is divisible by $2$, we have $-k^4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{z}$.

      "We can find the units digit of $3^a+7^b$ by looking at the units digits of $3^a$ and $7^b$.\n\nThe units digit of $3^a$ is $3,9,7,1$ in a cycle of 4.  The units digit of $7^b$ is $7,9,3,1$ in a cycle of 4.\n\nWe can find the units digit of $3^a+7^b$ by looking at the units digits of $3^a$ and $7^b$ and adding them together.  We get the following possibilities:\n\n- $3+7=10$ (units digit 0)\n- $3+9=12$ (units digit 2)\n- $3+3=6$ (units digit 6)\n- $3+1=4$ (units digit 4)\n- $9+7=16$ (units digit 6)\n- $9+9=18$ (units digit 8)\n- $9+3=12$ (units digit 2)\n- $9+1=10$ (units digit 0)\n- $7+7=14$ (units digit 4)\n- $7+9=16$ (units digit 6)\n- $7+3=10$ (units digit 0)\n- $7+1=8$ (units digit 8)\n\nOut of the 16 possibilities, there are 2 possibilities that give a units digit of 8.

Then, we can calculate the # of wins already on the table, which is $5 + 3 + 2 = 10$, so there are $12 - 10 = 2$ wins left in the mystery player. Now, we will make the key observation that there is only $2$ wins ($1$'s) per column as there are $2$ winners and $2$ losers in each round. Strategically looking through the columns counting the $1$'s and putting our own $2$ $1$'s when the column isn't already full yields $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\texttt{000101}}$.\n\n~SohumUttamchandani -edits apex304, lpieleanu"

And, each player will play each other player exactly twice. Each of these $12$ games will have $1$ winner and $1$ loser, so there will be a total of $12$ $1$'s and $12$ $0$'s in the win-loss table. Therefore, Tiyo will have $12-10=2$ $1$'s and $12-8=4$ $0$'s in his record.\n\nNow, all we have to do is figure out the order of these $1$'s and $0$'s. In every round, there are two games; the players are split into two pairs and the people in those pairs play each other. Thus, every round should have $2$ winners and $2$ losers which means that every column of the win-loss table should have $2$ $1$'s and $2$ $0$'s. Looking at the filled-in table so far, we see that columns $4$ and $6$ need one more $1$, so Tiyo must have $1$'s in those columns and $0$'s gone in the others.\nTherefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\texttt{000101}}.$\n\n~lpieleanu\n\nRemark: Note that we can skip straight to the reasoning used in the second paragraph (which is Solution 3 below)."

The second column also has to wins, so we give Tiyo 0. The third column follows this as well. In the fourth column, we see that Lola and Lolo both lost, and Tiya is the only one who won (1), so Tiyo also won (1). The fifth column follows the same as the first three, and the last column shows that Tiyo also won. So, Tiyo got: 000101. The only option that fits this is A.\n\n~revaprayag"

      "To minimize $|PQ|$, we need to minimize the sum of $|PY|$ and $|QY|$.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. $|XQ| = 2|MP|$\n2. $\\frac{|XY|}2 < |MP| < \\frac{3|XY|}2$\n\nFrom condition 1, we can write $|XQ| = 2|MP|$ as $|XQ| = 2(|MP| + |MY|)$, since $M$ is the midpoint of $XY$. This simplifies to $|XQ| = 2|MP| + 2|MY|$.\n\nNow, let's use condition 2 to express $|MP|$ in terms of $|XY|$. We have $\\frac{|XY|}2 < |MP| < \\frac{3|XY|}2$. Let's assume $|MP| = k|XY|$ for some $k$ between $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$. Then, we can write $|XQ| = 2k|XY| + 2|MY|$.\n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $XY$, we have $|MY| = \\frac{1}{2}|XY|$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $|XQ| = 2k|XY| + |XY| = (2k + 1)|XY|$.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle $\\triangle PQY$.

Since $|YQ| = |XQ| - |QX|$, we can substitute the expression for $|XQ|$ to get $|PQ| \\geq |PY| + |QY| - (2k + 1)|XY|$.\n\nTo minimize $|PQ|$, we need to minimize the sum $|PY| + |QY|$.

We have $|XQ| = 2|MP| + 2|MY| = 2(\\frac{1}{2}|XY|) + 2(\\frac{1}{2}|XY|) = |XY|$. Since $|XQ| = |XY|$, we have $|QX| = |XY|$.

This means that our assumption that $|MP| = k|XY|$ for some $k$ between $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$ is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the conditions. We have $\\frac{|XY|}2 < |MP| < \\frac{3|XY|}2$. Let's assume $|MP| = k|XY|$ for some $k$ between $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$. Then, we can write $|XQ| = 2k|XY| + 2|MY|$.

This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $|RQ| = |MP| + |QM|$ is incorrect.\n\nHowever, we can see that $|RQ| = |MP| + |QM|$ is a lower bound for $|RQ|$. Therefore, $|PQ| = 2|RQ|$ is a lower bound for $|PQ|$.\n\nTo minimize $|PQ|$, we need to minimize $|RQ|$.

        "content": "I claim that the only function $f$ that satisfies the constraints outlined within the problem is the function $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWe will proceed with strong induction. The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$. Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$.\n\nNow we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$, as it is either the product of two $f$-values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$-value that is equal to $1$, again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.\n\nLemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$, we then have $f(a)=1$.\n\nProof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$, or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$. Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$. Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$.\n\nNow we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$(this will always work as $p\\neq 2$(not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$, we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$, so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$. $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$. These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$, $100$, and $125$. However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$, as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$, which are both less than $p$ and are integers($p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$)). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$, we can prove something a bit more general.\n\nLemma 2: For any positive integer $n$, all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nProof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$, or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$. Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$, as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$, we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$, or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$.\n\nWe can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$, and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.\n\nNow we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$, we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$, clearly less than $p$(if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$(the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$. We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$, which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$, which obviously means it must be less than $n$. This proves the second of our claims.\n\nThis completes the second case of the inductive step, and therefore completes both the induction and the problem.\n~Solution by hyxue"

We can thus assume there are no two such $p\\ne q$. We now prove the assertion by induction on the first term of the sequence, $a_1$. The base step is basically proven, since if $a_1=1$ we can take $p=1$ and any $q>1$ we want. There must be a prime divisor $u|a_1$ which divides infinitely many terms of the sequence, which form some subsequence $(a_{k_n})_{n\\ge 1},\\ k_1=1$. Now apply the induction hypothesis to the sequence $\\left(\\frac{a_{k_n}}u\\right)_{n\\ge 1}$.\n\nThe above solution was posted and copyrighted by grobber.

Then there are $N$ values of $q$ which can be used to write $a_m$ in the form $a_m = xa_p + ya_q$.\n\nSince the sequence is increasing, we can write the $N$ values of $q$ in increasing order as $q_1 < q_2 < \\cdots < q_N$.  Then for each $q_i$, we can write $a_{q_i}$ in the form $a_{q_i} = xa_p + ya_i$ for some $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow consider the value $a_{q_{N+1}}$.  Since the sequence is increasing, we have $a_{q_{N+1}} > a_{q_N}$.  But we also have $a_{q_{N+1}} = xa_p + ya_{N+1}$ and $a_{q_N} = xa_p + ya_N$.  Since $a_{q_{N+1}} > a_{q_N}$, we have $xa_p + ya_{N+1} > xa_p + ya_N$.  This implies that $ya_{N+1} > ya_N$.\n\nSince $a_{q_{N+1}}$ is in the sequence, we have $a_{q_{N+1}} \\geq a_1$.  But we also have $a_{q_{N+1}} = xa_p + ya_{N+1}$ and $a_1 = xa_1 + ya_1$.  Since $a_{q_{N+1}} \\geq a_1$, we have $xa_p + ya_{N+1} \\geq xa_1 + ya_1$.  This implies that $ya_{N+1} \\geq ya_1$.\n\nSince $ya_{N+1} > ya_N$ and $ya_{N+1} \\geq ya_1$, we have $ya_{N+1} \\geq ya_N$.

Solving the last two equations for $c$ and $g$, we get $c=0$ and $g=0$.  Solving the first equation for $b$ and the last equation for $d$, we get $b=0$ and $d=8$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle are $A=(-6,0)$, $B=(0,8)$, $C=(-3,4)$, and $D=(0,4)$.\n\nThe length of the rectangle is $|AB|=|(-6)-(0)|=6$, and the width of the rectangle is $|BC|=|(0)-(4)|=4$.

This is because the smallest element in a subset of $r$ elements must be at least $r$, and at most $n$.\n\nSince there are $n-r+1$ possible smallest elements for each subset, and there are $\\binom{n}{r}$ subsets of $r$ elements, we can calculate the sum of the smallest elements for all subsets.\n\nLet $S$ denote the sum of the smallest elements for all subsets.

      "We can prove this by induction on $n$.\n\nFor the base case, consider $n = 1$.  There are $r$ subsets of $r$ elements of $\\{1\\}$, and the smallest element of each subset is $1$.

The smallest element in each subset can be any of the $n$ elements in the set. However, the number of subsets that have a particular smallest element is not the same for each element.\n\nLet's consider the number of subsets that have a smallest element $k$. The elements in the subset can be chosen from the remaining $n-k$ elements in the set. Since the subset has $r$ elements, the number of ways to choose these elements is $\\binom{n-k}{r-1}$. This is because we have already chosen the smallest element $k$, and we need to choose the remaining $r-1$ elements from the remaining $n-k$ elements.\n\nThe total number of subsets that have a smallest element $k$ is $\\binom{n-k}{r-1}$. Since $k$ can be any of the $n$ elements in the set, the total number of subsets that have a smallest element is $\\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n-k}{r-1}$.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the smallest elements in all subsets. For each element $k$, the smallest element in the subsets that have $k$ as the smallest element is $k$. The number of subsets that have $k$ as the smallest element is $\\binom{n-k}{r-1}$.

This number is equal to the number of subsets of $r-1$ elements that have a smallest member $k$, which is ${n-k-1 \\choose r-1}$.\n\nSince the total number of subsets of $r$ elements is ${n \\choose r}$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} (k+1) {n-k-1 \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} (k+1) {n-k-1 \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k-1 \\choose r-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} {n-k-1 \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k-1 \\choose r-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} {n-k \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that ${n-k \\choose r-1} = {n-k \\choose n-r}$ to simplify the equation:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose n-r} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} {n-k \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} {n-k \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nSubtracting $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1}$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$0 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} {n-k \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nThis equation holds for all $r$ and $n$, so we can use it to find the arithmetic mean of the smallest numbers in all subsets of $r$ elements.\n\nLet $S$ be the sum of the smallest numbers in all subsets of $r$ elements. Then, we have:\n\n$$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1}.$$\n\nSince the total number of subsets of $r$ elements is ${n \\choose r}$, we can divide both sides of the equation by ${n \\choose r}$ to get:\n\n$$\\frac{S}{{n \\choose r}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1}}{{n \\choose r}}.$$\n\nUsing the fact that ${n-k \\choose r-1} = {n-k \\choose n-r}$, we can simplify the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{S}{{n \\choose r}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose n-r}}{{n \\choose r}}.$$\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{S}{{n \\choose r}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n-r+1} k {n-k \\choose r-1}}{{n \\choose r}}.$$\n\n"

      "Let's denote the number of problems solved by contestant $i$ in Part I as $x_i$ and in Part II as $y_i$.\n\nSince each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 7n$, where $n$ is the number of contestants.\n\nWe are also given that for each pair of problems, there were exactly two contestants who solved both of them. This means that for each pair of problems $(i,j)$, there are exactly two contestants who solved both $i$ and $j$. Let's denote the number of contestants who solved both $i$ and $j$ as $c_{ij}$.\n\nSince there are $28$ problems in total, there are ${28 \\choose 2} = 378$ pairs of problems. Since each pair has exactly two contestants who solved both problems, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} = 378$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of contestants who solved each problem. For each problem $i$, let's denote the number of contestants who solved it as $z_i$. Then, we have $z_i = 2c_{ij}$ for each pair $(i,j)$.\n\nSince each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i = 7n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems that each contestant solved. For each contestant $i$, let's denote the number of pairs of problems that $i$ solved as $p_i$. Then, we have $p_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij}$.\n\nSince each pair of problems has exactly two contestants who solved both problems, we have $p_i = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} = 2 \\cdot 378 = 756$ for each contestant $i$.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of pairs of problems that all contestants solved. We have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = n \\cdot 756$.\n\nSince each pair of problems has exactly two contestants who solved both problems, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 2 \\cdot {28 \\choose 2} = 2 \\cdot 378 = 756$.\n\nTherefore, we have $n \\cdot 756 = 756$, which implies that $n = 1$.\n\nThis means that there is only one contestant, and this contestant solved all $28$ problems.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, since each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there is only one contestant who solved all $28$ problems must be false.\n\nThis means that there must be at least two contestants, and each contestant solved fewer than $28$ problems.\n\nLet's consider the number of problems solved by each contestant. Suppose that there is a contestant $i$ who solved fewer than $4$ problems in Part I. Then, we have $x_i < 4$.\n\nSince each contestant solved $7$ problems altogether, we have $x_i + y_i = 7$.\n\nSince $x_i < 4$, we have $y_i > 3$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems that contestant $i$ solved. We have $p_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ji}$.\n\nSince each pair of problems has exactly two contestants who solved both problems, we have $p_i = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ji} = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij}$.\n\nSince $x_i < 4$, we have $p_i < 8$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of pairs of problems that each contestant solved. For each contestant $j$, let's denote the number of pairs of problems that $j$ solved as $p_j$. Then, we have $p_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ji}$.\n\nSince each pair of problems has exactly two contestants who solved both problems, we have $p_j = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ji} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij}$.\n\nSince $p_i < 8$, we have $p_j < 8$ for each contestant $j$.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of pairs of problems that all contestants solved.

        "content": "We can force this triangle to be equilateral because the ratios are always $3:3:1$ no matter which rotation, and with the symmetry of the equilateral triangle, it is safe to assume that this may be the truth (symmetry is very important, kids). Then, we can do a simple coordinate bash. Let $B$ be at $(0,0)$, $A$ be at $(3,3\\sqrt{3})$, and $C$ be at $(6,0)$. We then create a new point $O$ at the center of everything. It should be noted because of similarity between $\\triangle N_{1}N_{2}N_{3}$ and $\\triangle ABC$, we can find the scale factor between the two triangle by simply dividing $N_{2}O$(not nitrous oxide) by $AO$. First, we need to find the coordinates of $O$ and $N_{2}$. $O$ is easily found at $(3,\\sqrt{3})$ and $N_{2}$ be found by calculating equation of $BE$ and $AD$.$E$ is located $(4,2\\sqrt{3})$ so $BE$ is $y=\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. $D$ be at $(4,0)$ and the slope is $-3\\sqrt{3}$. We see that they be at the same $x$-value. Quick maths calculate the x value to be $4-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ which be $3\\frac{3}{7}$. Another quick maths caculation of the $y$-value lead it be equal $2\\sqrt{3}*\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+3\\sqrt{3}}$ which be $1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3}$. Peferct, so now $N_{2}$ be at $(3\\frac{3}{7},1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$. Subtracting this coordinate with the coordinates of the center $O$ give you $(\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$. Pythagorean theorem on that gives $\\frac{\\sqrt{84}}{7}$ which simplifies to $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}.$ $A$ is vertically above $O$ by $2\\sqrt{3}$ units. The scale factor is thus $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$ giving us an answer of: ~Lopkiloinm \\[\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{7}[ABC]}\\] (Note: the presence of $7$ in the denominator gives hints on the answer, so when you see it, 1/7 looks like the obvious choice) \\[\\]\n(Another note: the question gives you the ratio of $3:3:1$ so I did not need to use that many steps to calculate the coordinate of $N_2$, directly attaining it to be at $(3\\frac{3}{7},1\\frac{5}{7}\\sqrt{3})$ After realizing this, this method should actually be pretty quick, may even be quicker than the non coordinate method. Regardless, if you don't get the ratio and you encounter a problem similar to this, the coordinate bash with all these calculations should get you the correct answer. Also, there is an even bashier way using all the points and shoelace formula. That takes too much time.)"

      "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\na) To find the points $P$ such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at $P$, we need to consider the geometry of the trapezoid. Let's denote the points where the legs meet the bases as $A$, $B$, $D$, and $E$.\n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs $AD$ and $BE$ are congruent, and the altitude $h$ is perpendicular to both bases.\n\nLet's consider a point $P$ on the axis of symmetry of the trapezoid. We can draw a line from $P$ to the midpoint $M$ of the base $a$. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the line $PM$ is perpendicular to the base $a$.\n\nNow, let's consider the leg $AD$. Since it subtends a right angle at $P$, the line $AD$ is perpendicular to the line $PM$. This means that the line $AD$ is also perpendicular to the base $a$.\n\nSimilarly, the leg $BE$ subtends a right angle at $P$, so the line $BE$ is also perpendicular to the line $PM$.\n\nSince the lines $AD$ and $BE$ are perpendicular to the line $PM$, they must be parallel to each other. This means that the points $A$ and $B$ must be equidistant from the point $P$.\n\nTherefore, the points $P$ such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at $P$ are the points on the axis of symmetry of the trapezoid that are equidistant from the points $A$ and $B$.\n\nb) To calculate the distance of $P$ from either base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed by the point $P$, the midpoint $M$ of the base $a$, and the foot of the altitude $h$ from $P$ to the base $c$. The length of the base of this triangle is $h$, and the length of the leg is $PM$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n$$PM^2 + h^2 = (a+c)/2^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$PM^2 = (a+c)/4 - h^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$PM = \\sqrt{(a+c)/4 - h^2}$$\n\nThis is the distance of $P$ from the base $a$.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider the right triangle formed by the point $P$, the midpoint $N$ of the base $c$, and the foot of the altitude $h$ from $P$ to the base $a$. The length of the base of this triangle is $h$, and the length of the leg is $PN$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n$$PN^2 + h^2 = (a+c)/2^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$PN^2 = (a+c)/4 - h^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$PN = \\sqrt{(a+c)/4 - h^2}$$\n\nThis is the distance of $P$ from the base $c$.\n\nc) To determine under what conditions such points $P$ actually exist, we need to consider the geometry of the trapezoid.\n\nFor the points $P$ to exist, the distance $PM$ must be greater than zero, and the distance $PN$ must be greater than zero.\n\nThis means that the expression $(a+c)/4 - h^2$ must be greater than zero.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$(a+c)/4 > h^2$$\n\nSince $h$ is the altitude of the trapezoid, it is greater than zero.

      "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into three parts as requested.\n\na) To find all points P such that both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P, we need to consider the geometry of the trapezoid. \n\nLet's denote the points where the legs of the trapezoid intersect the bases as A, B, C, and D. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are congruent, and the altitude is perpendicular to the bases.\n\nConsider a point P on the axis of symmetry of the trapezoid. Let's denote the distance from P to the base a as x and the distance from P to the base c as y. Since P lies on the axis of symmetry, the distance from P to the base a is equal to the distance from P to the base c, i.e., x = y.\n\nNow, consider the right triangles formed by the legs of the trapezoid and the line segments PA and PC. Since the legs subtend right angles at P, the triangles are right triangles.\n\nLet's denote the length of the leg as z. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nPA^2 + h^2 = z^2... (1)\nPC^2 + h^2 = z^2... (2)\n\nSince x = y, we can write:\n\nPA = PC = z - x\nPC = z - y\n\nSubstituting these expressions into (1) and (2), we get:\n\n(z - x)^2 + h^2 = z^2\n(z - y)^2 + h^2 = z^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nz^2 - 2zx + x^2 + h^2 = z^2\nz^2 - 2zy + y^2 + h^2 = z^2\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n-2zx + x^2 = -2zy + y^2\nx^2 - y^2 = 2z(y - x)\n\nSince x = y, we can substitute y = x into the equation:\n\nx^2 - x^2 = 2z(x - x)\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true for all values of x. However, we need to consider the constraints on x and y.\n\nSince x = y, we know that x and y are non-negative. Additionally, x and y must be less than or equal to the length of the bases a and c, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the points P that satisfy the condition are those that lie on the line segment connecting the midpoints of the bases a and c.\n\nb) To calculate the distance of P from either base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSince x = y, we can write:\n\nx^2 + h^2 = z^2\nx^2 + h^2 = (z - x)^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + h^2 = z^2 - 2zx + x^2\nh^2 = z^2 - 2zx\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = sqrt(z^2 - h^2)\n\nSince x is non-negative, we can write:\n\nx = sqrt(z^2 - h^2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance of P from either base:\n\ndistance from base a = x = sqrt(z^2 - h^2)\ndistance from base c = y = sqrt(z^2 - h^2)\n\nc) To determine under what conditions such points P actually exist, we need to consider the constraints on the parameters of the trapezoid.\n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are congruent, and the altitude is perpendicular to the bases. This implies that the trapezoid is a right trapezoid.\n\nFor a right trapezoid, the legs are the hypotenuses of right triangles formed by the altitude and the line segments connecting the midpoints of the bases.\n\nLet's denote the length of the altitude as h and the length of the legs as z. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nh^2 + (a/2)^2 = z^2\nh^2 + (c/2)^2 = z^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh^2 + a^2/4 = z^2\nh^2 + c^2/4 = z^2\n\nSubtracting the two equations, we get:\n\na^2/4 - c^2/4 = 0\na^2 = c^2\n\nThis implies that the trapezoid is an isosceles trapezoid with equal bases.\n\nTherefore, the points P that satisfy the condition exist only when the trapezoid is an isosceles trapezoid with equal bases.",

Since the legs subtend right angles at P, we can form right triangles with the legs and the altitude.\n\nLet's denote the distance from P to the shorter base as y. Then, the distance from P to the longer base is a - 2y.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the leg, the altitude, and the distance from P to the shorter base, we get:\n\nx^2 = h^2 + y^2\n\nSimilarly, using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the leg, the altitude, and the distance from P to the longer base, we get:\n\nx^2 = h^2 + (a - 2y)^2\n\nSince both equations are equal to x^2, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nh^2 + y^2 = h^2 + (a - 2y)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ny^2 = (a - 2y)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\ny^2 = a^2 - 4ay + 4y^2\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n3y^2 - 4ay + a^2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in y. Solving for y, we get:\n\ny = (2a \u00b1 \u221a(16a^2 - 12a^2)) / 6\ny = (2a \u00b1 \u221a4a^2) / 6\ny = (2a \u00b1 2a) / 6\n\nSimplifying, we get two possible values for y:\n\ny = a/3 or y = a/3\n\nHowever, since y cannot be equal to a/3 twice, we discard the second solution. Therefore, the only possible value for y is:\n\ny = a/3\n\nb) To calculate the distance of P from either base, we can use the value of y we found in part a):\n\nDistance from shorter base = y = a/3\nDistance from longer base = a - 2y = a - 2(a/3) = a/3\n\nc) To determine under what conditions such points P actually exist, we need to consider the geometry of the trapezoid.\n\nFor the points P to exist, the distance y must be positive, which means that the shorter base must be shorter than the longer base. This is because the distance y is the distance from the midpoint of the shorter base to the point P, and this distance must be less than half the length of the longer base.\n\nAdditionally, the altitude h must be non-zero, because if h = 0, the trapezoid would degenerate into a rectangle, and there would be no points P that satisfy the condition.\n\nFinally, the length of the legs x must be non-zero, because if x = 0, the trapezoid would degenerate into a line segment, and there would be no points P that satisfy the condition.\n\nIn summary, the points P exist if and only if:\n\n* The shorter base is shorter than the longer base (a < c)\n* The altitude h is non-zero (h \u2260 0)\n* The length of the legs x is non-zero (x \u2260 0)\n\nThese conditions ensure that the trapezoid has a non-degenerate shape and that the points P can be found on the axis of symmetry.",

Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the length of the legs is equal, and the altitude is perpendicular to the bases.\n\nSince both legs subtend right angles at P, we can draw a perpendicular line from P to the base c at point O. \n\nNow, consider the right triangle PQO. Since PQ is the altitude of the trapezoid, it is perpendicular to the base a. Therefore, angle PQO is 90 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, consider the right triangle PNO. Since PN is the altitude of the trapezoid, it is perpendicular to the base c. Therefore, angle PNO is 90 degrees.\n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the length of the legs is equal. Therefore, the length of PQ is equal to the length of PN.\n\nNow, consider the right triangle QMO.

      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the hands of the clock to be together and then 180 degrees apart.\n\nLet's assume the time when the hands of the clock are together is x hours after 8 a.m. Since the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, it moves 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, which is 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nAt the time when the hands are together, the minute hand is at x hours * 60 minutes + 0 minutes = 60x minutes. The hour hand is at 8 hours * 60 minutes + x hours * 30 minutes = 480 + 30x minutes.\n\nSince the hands are together, the difference between the two angles is 0 degrees. We can set up the equation:\n\n(60x - (480 + 30x)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n30x - 480 = 0\n30x = 480\nx = 16 hours\n\nSo, the hands of the clock are together at 8 a.m. + 16 hours = 12 a.m. (next day).\n\nNow, let's calculate the time when the hands of the clock are 180 degrees apart. The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, and the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute. The difference between the two angles is 180 degrees.\n\nLet's assume the time when the hands are 180 degrees apart is y hours after 12 a.m. Since the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, it moves 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, which is 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nAt the time when the hands are 180 degrees apart, the minute hand is at y hours * 60 minutes + 0 minutes = 60y minutes. The hour hand is at 12 hours * 60 minutes + y hours * 30 minutes = 720 + 30y minutes.\n\nSince the hands are 180 degrees apart, the difference between the two angles is 180 degrees. We can set up the equation:\n\n(60y - (720 + 30y)) = 180\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n30y - 720 = 180\n30y = 900\ny = 30 hours\n\nSo, the hands of the clock are 180 degrees apart at 12 a.m. + 30 hours = 12 p.m.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time difference between 12 a.m. and 12 p.m., which is 12 hours. However, we also need to add the time difference between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m., which is 4 hours.\n\nThe total time difference is 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours. However, we need to subtract the time difference between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m., which is 4 hours, from the total time difference.\n\nThe correct time difference is 16 hours - 4 hours = 12 hours. However, we need to convert this to hours and minutes. 12 hours is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nSince 12 hours is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes, we can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours\n\nThe time difference is 12 hours, which is equal to 12 hours * 60 minutes = 720 minutes. We can convert this to hours and minutes by dividing by 60.\n\n720 minutes",
      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the hands of the clock to move from together to $180^\\circ$ apart.\n\nLet's consider the position of the hour hand at time $t$ hours after 8 a.m. The hour hand moves $360^\\circ$ in 12 hours, so it moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$ per hour. Therefore, the hour hand moves $30t$ degrees after $t$ hours.\n\nThe minute hand moves $360^\\circ$ in 60 minutes, so it moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60} = 6^\\circ$ per minute. Therefore, the minute hand moves $6t$ degrees after $t$ hours.\n\nSince the hands are together at 8 a.m., the initial position of the hour hand is $0^\\circ$ and the initial position of the minute hand is $0^\\circ$. Therefore, the initial difference between the positions of the two hands is $0^\\circ$.\n\nAfter $t$ hours, the position of the hour hand is $30t^\\circ$ and the position of the minute hand is $6t^\\circ$. Since the hands are $180^\\circ$ apart, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$|30t - 6t| = 180$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$|24t| = 180$$\n\nSince $t$ is a positive value, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve for $t$:\n\n$$24t = 180$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{180}{24}$$\n\n$$t = 7.5$$\n\nTherefore, the trip takes $7.5$ hours.

As the hour hand moves, it covers $360^\\circ$ in 12 hours, so it covers $30^\\circ$ in 1 hour. The minute hand covers $360^\\circ$ in 60 minutes, so it covers $6^\\circ$ in 1 minute.\n3. Since the hands are together at 8 a.m., we need to find the time it takes for the hour hand to move $180^\\circ$ and the minute hand to move $180^\\circ$.\n4. The hour hand moves $30^\\circ$ in 1 hour, so it will move $180^\\circ$ in $\\frac{180}{30} = 6$ hours.\n5. The minute hand moves $6^\\circ$ in 1 minute, so it will move $180^\\circ$ in $\\frac{180}{6} = 30$ minutes.\n6. However, the minute hand is moving faster than the hour hand, so we need to find the time it takes for the minute hand to catch up to the hour hand.\n7. Since the minute hand moves $6^\\circ$ in 1 minute and the hour hand moves $30^\\circ$ in 1 hour, the minute hand moves $6^\\circ$ in $\\frac{1}{2}$ hour.\n8. Therefore, the minute hand will catch up to the hour hand in $\\frac{1}{2}$ hour, which is equivalent to 30 minutes.\n9. Since the hour hand moves $30^\\circ$ in 1 hour, it will move $30^\\circ$ in $\\frac{1}{2}$ hour, which is equivalent to 15 minutes.\n10. So, the total time it takes for the hands of the clock to move from being together to being $180^\\circ$ apart is $6$ hours $+ 30$ minutes $- 15$ minutes $= 6$ hours $15$ minutes.\n\nHowever, the answer choices do not include this answer.

      "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the hands of the clock to move from being together to being 180 degrees apart.\n\nLet's break down the movement of the clock hands:\n\n1. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute.\n2. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nWhen the hands are together, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the hour hand is at the 12 o'clock position as well. This means the angle between the hands is 0 degrees.\n\nAs the minute hand moves, the angle between the hands increases at a rate of 6 - 0.5 = 5.5 degrees per minute.\n\nSince the hands are 180 degrees apart when Henry arrives at his destination, we need to find the time it takes for the angle to increase from 0 degrees to 180 degrees.\n\nLet's convert 180 degrees to minutes: 180 degrees / 5.5 degrees per minute = 32.73 minutes (approximately).\n\nHowever, we need to consider the time it takes for the minute hand to move from the 12 o'clock position to the 2 o'clock position, which is 60 minutes. Since the hands are together at 8 a.m., we need to add the time it takes for the minute hand to move from the 12 o'clock position to the 2 o'clock position, which is 60 minutes.\n\nNow, let's subtract the time it takes for the angle to increase from 0 degrees to 180 degrees (32.73 minutes) from the total time (60 minutes):\n\n60 minutes - 32.73 minutes = 27.27 minutes\n\nSince the question asks for the time in hours and minutes, we can convert the decimal part to minutes:\n\n27.27 minutes \u2248 27 minutes\n\nNow, let's add the time it takes for the angle to increase from 0 degrees to 180 degrees (32.73 minutes) to the time it takes for the minute hand to move from the 12 o'clock position to the 2 o'clock position (60 minutes):\n\n60 minutes + 32.73 minutes \u2248 6 hours 32.73 minutes\n\nConverting the decimal part to minutes:\n\n32.73 minutes \u2248 33 minutes\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time in hours and minutes, and the answer choices are given in a specific format. Let's convert the time to the format given in the answer choices:\n\n6 hours 33 minutes - 7/11 minutes \u2248 6 hours 43 minutes - 7/11 minutes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{6 hr. 43-7/11 min.}}$"

      "To prove that one can choose three points of each color in such a way that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent, we can use the following approach:\n\n1.  Divide the circle into 108 equal arcs by drawing a line through the center of the circle and connecting two adjacent points of the same color. This creates 108 equal arcs, each with a length of $\\frac{1}{108}$ of the circle's circumference.\n2.  Since the circle is divided into 432 congruent arcs, each arc has a length of $\\frac{1}{432}$ of the circle's circumference.\n3.  Now, consider the 108 points of each color. Since the points are colored in four colors, we can label them as follows: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), and Yellow (Y).\n4.  For each color, choose three points and draw a line through the center of the circle and connecting two adjacent points of the same color. This creates 108 equal arcs, each with a length of $\\frac{1}{108}$ of the circle's circumference.\n5.  Since the points are colored in four colors, we can label the arcs as follows: $R_1, R_2,..., R_{108}$ for Red, $G_1, G_2,..., G_{108}$ for Green, $B_1, B_2,..., B_{108}$ for Blue, and $Y_1, Y_2,..., Y_{108}$ for Yellow.\n6.  Now, consider the triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color. Since the points are equally spaced, the triangles are congruent.\n7.  To prove that the triangles are congruent, we can use the fact that the angles of the triangles are equal. Since the points are equally spaced, the angles of the triangles are equal to the angles formed by the lines connecting the center of the circle to the points.\n8.  Since the lines connecting the center of the circle to the points are equal, the angles formed by these lines are equal. Therefore, the angles of the triangles are equal, and the triangles are congruent.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that one can choose three points of each color in such a way that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.",

Divide the circle into 108 equal arcs, each corresponding to one of the colors. This is possible because the circle is divided into 432 congruent arcs, and 432 is divisible by 108.\n2.  Since the points of the same color are evenly distributed, we can choose one point from each color in each of the 108 arcs. This ensures that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.\n3.  To prove that the triangles are congruent, we can use the fact that the points of the same color are evenly distributed. This means that the distance between consecutive points of the same color is the same.\n4.  Consider two points of the same color, say Red. The distance between these two points is the same as the distance between any other two points of the same color. This is because the points of the same color are evenly distributed.\n5.  Now, consider a triangle formed by three points of the same color, say Red. The distance between the first and second points of the Red triangle is the same as the distance between the first and third points of the Red triangle. This is because the points of the same color are evenly distributed.\n6.  Similarly, the distance between the second and third points of the Red triangle is the same as the distance between the second and first points of the Red triangle.\n7.  Therefore, the three sides of the Red triangle are equal, which means that the triangle is equilateral.\n8.  The same argument can be applied to the Green, Blue, and Yellow triangles, which means that all four triangles are equilateral.\n9.  Since the triangles are equilateral, they are also congruent, which means that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that one can choose three points of each color in such a way that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.",

To prove that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent, we need to show that the radii of the arcs subtended by the points of each color are equal.\n5.  Since the circle is divided into 432 congruent arcs, the total circumference of the circle is 432 times the length of each arc. Let's call the length of each arc 'a'. Then, the total circumference of the circle is 432a.\n6.  Since the points of each color are evenly distributed, the total length of the arcs subtended by the points of each color is equal to the total circumference of the circle divided by 4. Therefore, the length of each arc subtended by the points of each color is 432a/4 = 108a.\n7.  Now, consider the triangle formed by three points of the same color. The radii of the arcs subtended by these points are equal, since they subtend equal arcs. Therefore, the triangle formed by these three points is an isosceles triangle.\n8.  Since the points of each color are evenly distributed, the base of the isosceles triangle is equal to the length of the arc subtended by the points of each color, which is 108a. The height of the isosceles triangle is also equal to the length of the arc subtended by the points of each color, which is 108a.\n9.

        "content": "The key observation for this solution is to observe that pods $C$ and $F$ both have degree 5; that is, they are connected to five other pods. This implies that $C$ and $F$ must contain grades 1 and 7 in either order (if $C$ or $F$ contained any of grades 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then there would only be four possible grades for five pods, a contradiction). It does not matter which grade $C$ and $F$ gets (see Solution 2 below), so we will assume that pod $C$ is assigned grade 1, and pod $F$ is assigned grade 7.\n\nNext, pod $D$ is the only pod which is not adjacent to pod $F$, so pod $D$ must be assigned grade 6. Similarly, pod $G$ must be assigned grade 2.\n\nLastly, we need to assign grades 3, 4, and 5 to pods $A$, $B$, and $E$. Note that $A$ and $B$ are adjacent; therefore, pods $A$ and $B$ must contain grades 3 and 5. We conclude that $E$ must be assigned grade 4. The requested sum is $1+4+7 = \\mathbf{(A)\\,} 12$."

We claim that if the initial labeling is valid (i.e., each pair of connected pods has grades differing by 2 or more), then so will the new labeling. This follows as if $|x-y| \\ge 2$, then $|(8-x)-(8-y)|=|-x+y| = |x-y| \\ge 2$. This shows that if there is an assignment $(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)$ of grades to the pods, where $\\{a,b,\\ldots,g\\} = \\{1,2,\\ldots,7\\}$, then there is a second, valid assignment.\n\nBecause this is an AMC 8 problem and only one answer is correct, we can conclude that $c+e+f = (8-c)+(8-e)+(8-f)$. Simplifying and solving for $c+e+f$ gives $c+e+f = \\mathbf{(A)\\,} 12$.\n\n-scrabbler94"

      "Let's start by examining the figure. We see that $C$ and $E$ are connected by a walkway, as are $E$ and $F$. We also see that $C$ and $F$ are not connected by a walkway.\n\nSince the grade levels in each pair of connected pods differ by at least 2, we know that the grade level in pod $C$ must be 2 more than the grade level in pod $E$. We also know that the grade level in pod $F$ must be 2 more than the grade level in pod $E$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible grade levels for pod $E$. If $E$ has grade level 1, then $C$ has grade level 3, and $F$ has grade level 5. If $E$ has grade level 2, then $C$ has grade level 4, and $F$ has grade level 6. If $E$ has grade level 3, then $C$ has grade level 5, and $F$ has grade level 7. If $E$ has grade level 4, then $C$ has grade level 6, and $F$ has grade level 8. If $E$ has grade level 5, then $C$ has grade level 7, and $F$ has grade level 9. If $E$ has grade level 6, then $C$ has grade level 8, and $F$ has grade level 10. If $E$ has grade level 7, then $C$ has grade level 9, and $F$ has grade level 11.\n\nWe can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10, 4 + 2 + 6 = 12, 5 + 2 + 7 = 14, 6 + 2 + 8 = 16, 7 + 2 + 9 = 18, 8 + 2 + 10 = 20, or 9 + 2 + 11 = 22.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $A, B, D$, and $G$ is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20, 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24, or 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 28.\n\nSince the sum of the grade levels assigned to all the pods must be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 156, we can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ must be 156 - 16 - 20 - 24 - 28 = 68.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $A, B, D$, and $G$ must be 156 - 10 - 12 - 14 - 16 - 18 - 20 - 22 = 44.\n\nSince the sum of the grade levels assigned to all the pods must be 156, we can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ must be 156 - 44 = 112.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $A, B, D$, and $G$ must be 156 - 68 = 88.\n\nSince the sum of the grade levels assigned to all the pods must be 156, we can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ must be 156 - 88 = 68.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $A, B, D$, and $G$ must be 156 - 112 = 44.\n\nSince the sum of the grade levels assigned to all the pods must be 156, we can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ must be 156 - 44 = 112.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $A, B, D$, and $G$ must be 156 - 68 = 88.\n\nSince the sum of the grade levels assigned to all the pods must be 156, we can see that the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods $C, E$, and $F$ must be 156 - 88 = 68.\n\nHowever, we can",

Pod $G$ can be a $2$ or a $6$.\n\nWe can then use the information given in the problem to narrow down the possible grade levels for each pod. We know that each pair of connected pods has been assigned grades differing by 2 or more grade levels. This means that the difference between the grade levels of any two connected pods must be at least 2.\n\nLooking at the figure, we can see that pods $A$ and $E$ are connected by a walkway.

We also know that the grade level of pod $B$ must be either $3$ or $5$, and the grade level of pod $D$ must be either $1$ or $7$.\n\nSince the difference between the grade levels of any two connected pods must be at least 2, we can conclude that the grade level of pod $A$ must be $1$, and the grade level of pod $E$ must be $3$.

The area of each smaller section then must be $\\frac{9\\pi}{3}$ or $3\\pi$. The larger sections trisect a \"ring\" which is the difference of two circles, one with radius $3$, the other radius $6$.

So there is one prime $p=7$ such that $\\gcd \\left( P(x),P(x+2) \\right)>1$.\n\nIf $y=3$, it is obvious that $p=3$ satisfy and is the only answer.\n\nIf $y=4$, we do the similar thing and get $p \\mid 2x+5$ and $p \\mid x^2+x+1$ so $p=19$.\n___________________________\nNow, back to the problem, since there doesn't exists any prime $p$ for $y=1$ so $b \\ge 3$. The only prime for $y=2$ is $p=7$ so if we choose $7 \\mid P(x+1), 7 \\mid P(x+3)$ then there will be a number $7 \\nmid P(x+2)$ remains. This means $b \\ge 5$ since we need a prime $p \\mid P(x+2)$ and $p \\mid P(x+y)$ but $y \\ge 5$ since $p \\ne 7$.\n\nIf $b=5$, we consider two cases, where there are two numbers that are divisible by $19$ (which means $19 \\mid P(x+1), 19 \\mid P(x+5)$), the middle-three numbers $P(x+2),P(x+3),P(x+4)$ we can't find a way make each two of them have common prime factor. If no two are divisible by $19$ then they can only be divisible by $7,3$, but it can't cover all $5$ \"consecutive\" numbers.\n\nIf $b=6$ then we can pick $19 \\mid P(x+2),P(x+6), 3 \\mid P(x+1), P(x+4), 7 \\mid P(x+3), 7 \\mid P(x+5)$.\n\nSo the final answer is $b=6$."

This partitions the segment into $1000$ congruent pieces that each pass through $f(3, 5)$ cells, which means the answer is \\[1000f(3, 5).\\] Note that a new square is entered when the lines pass through one of the lines in the coordinate grid, which for $f(3, 5)$ happens $3-1+5-1=6$ times. Because $3$ and $5$ are relatively prime, no lattice point except for the endpoints intersects the line segment from $(0, 0)$ to $(3, 5).$ This means that including the first cell closest to $(0, 0),$ The segment passes through $f(3, 5)=6+1=7$ cells.

The line segment is parallel to the $x$-axis, so the width of the rectangle formed by the line segment is $3000-2000=1000$.  The height of the rectangle is the length of the line segment, which is $173.21$.  The area of the rectangle is $1000\\cdot173.21=173210$.  The number of cells that Rodrigo will color is the area of the rectangle divided by the area of a single cell, which is $173210/1=173210$.

      "We have that $AC=5$ and $AB=4$, so the perimeter of $\\triangle ACD$ is $5+3+BD=8+BD$.  The perimeter of $\\triangle ABD$ is $AB+BD+AD=4+BD+AD$.  Since the perimeters are equal, we have that $8+BD=4+BD+AD$, so $AD=4$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the area of $\\triangle ABD$: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area}(\\triangle ABD)&=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot AD\\cdot BD\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4\\cdot BD\\\\\n&=2BD.\n\\end{align*}We also have that $BD=AD+DC=4+3=7$, so the area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $2BD=2\\cdot 7=\\boxed{\\frac{14}{2}=\\frac{7}{1}=7}$.",
      "We can set up an equation for the perimeter of $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle ABD$. Let $x$ be the length of $CD$. Then the perimeter of $\\triangle ACD$ is $4+x+3=7+x$, and the perimeter of $\\triangle ABD$ is $5+x+4=9+x$. Since the two perimeters are equal, we have $7+x=9+x$, so $x=2$. The area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 6$. However, we can also use the ratio of the heights of the triangles to find the area of $\\triangle ABD$. The height of $\\triangle ACD$ is $3$, and the height of $\\triangle ABD$ is $3-\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{5}{2}$. The ratio of the heights of the triangles is $\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{3}=\\frac{5}{6}$, so the ratio of the areas of the triangles is $\\frac{5}{6}$.

The radius of the image circle is half the original radius, which is $\\frac{1}{2}r$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the locus of the midpoint\nAs $Q$ varies over the circle, the midpoint $M$ of $PQ$ traces out a circle centered at the midpoint of $P$ and with radius $\\frac{1}{2}r$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{(E)}}$"

The second player now selects any empty square $l$ such that $\\text{min}\\,(|l-1|,|l-2000|,|l-k|) > 3$, and fills in a S. The first player may again play anywhere, say $m$. If the second player can now complete SOS, he does so; otherwise, if $l > m$ he fills an S in $l + 3$ and if $l < m$ he fills an S in $l-3$.\n\nWe thus have two Ss separated by two empty squares. Note that if any player plays any letter between the two Ss, the other player can always complete a SOS.\n\nNow the second player repeats the following algorithm:\n\nIf he can complete SOS on his turn, he does so.\nOtherwise, since there are an odd number of empty squares at the beginning of his turn, there must be either one empty square surrounded by two filled squares or one empty square surrounded by two empty squares. In both cases, the player places an O in that square. In both situations, it is easy to verify that the first player cannot win on the next turn.\n\nEventually, assuming the second player has not won yet (and since the first player does not have a winning opportunity yet), this algorithm must stop. It follows that all of the empty squares are now in pairs. Since there are an even number of empty squares, it is the first player's turn. If the first player plays on one of any pair of empty squares that does not have Ss on both its sides, then the second player plays any letter in the other square of the pair. Then, we will only have pairs of empty squares with Ss on both sides remaining (since from the first moves we have constructed at least one, and no one has played between them otherwise the game will have ended), and the first player will have to play between them, so that the second player will win."

      "To prove that the second player has a winning strategy, we can use a combination of induction and a clever observation.\n\nLet's define the winning condition for the second player as follows: the second player wins if they can force the first player to create three consecutive boxes that spell SOS, regardless of the first player's moves.\n\nWe can prove this by induction on the number of moves made by the first player.\n\nBase case: If the first player makes 0 moves, the second player wins immediately, as there are no consecutive boxes to spell SOS.\n\nInductive step: Suppose that the second player has a winning strategy for the first $n$ moves made by the first player.

The last move is an S.\n2. The last move is an O.\n\nCase 1: The last move is an S.\n\nIn this case, the first player has created a sequence of three consecutive boxes that spell SOS, but the second player can still win by making the next move an O.

      "To prove that the second player has a winning strategy, we can use a combination of induction and a clever observation about the game's structure.\n\nLet's define a \"winning position\" as a position where the first player has three consecutive boxes that spell SOS. We can also define a \"losing position\" as a position where the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS, and all boxes are filled.\n\nNow, let's consider the base case of the induction. Suppose the game starts with the first player writing an S in the first box. The second player can respond with an O in the second box, and then write an S in the third box. This creates a winning position for the second player, since the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step. Suppose the game is in a position where the first player has written an S in the first box, and the second player has responded with an O in the second box. We can assume that the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS.\n\nWe can make the following observation: if the first player writes an S in the next box, the second player can respond with an O in the next box, and then write an S in the box after that. This creates a new winning position for the second player.\n\nTo see why this works, consider the following:\n\n* If the first player writes an S in the next box, the second player can respond with an O in the next box. This means that the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS.\n* If the second player writes an S in the box after that, the first player can respond with an O in the box after that. This means that the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS.\n* If the first player writes an S in the box after that, the second player can respond with an O in the box after that, and then write an S in the box after that. This creates a new winning position for the second player.\n\nTherefore, the second player can always respond to the first player's move in a way that creates a new winning position. This means that the second player has a winning strategy.\n\nTo formalize this argument, we can use the following inductive step:\n\n* Suppose the game is in a position where the first player has written an S in the first box, and the second player has responded with an O in the second box.\n* We can assume that the first player has not yet produced three consecutive boxes that spell SOS.\n* If the first player writes an S in the next box, the second player can respond with an O in the next box, and then write an S in the box after that. This creates a new winning position for the second player.\n* Therefore, the second player can always respond to the first player's move in a way that creates a new winning position.\n\nBy induction, we can conclude that the second player has a winning strategy.\n\nIt's worth noting that this strategy works because the game's structure is such that the second player can always respond to the first player's move in a way that creates a new winning position. The key insight is that the first player's move can always be responded to by the second player in a way that creates a new winning position, rather than simply blocking the first player's move.",

This is because the first player needs to create three consecutive S's, but since the grid is filled with S's, the first player will always be blocked by the existing S's.\n\nNow, let's consider the base case for the induction. Suppose the grid is filled with S's, except for one empty square. The first player can never win, because they will always be blocked by the existing S's. Therefore, the second player can win in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step. Suppose the grid is filled with S's, except for three consecutive empty squares. The first player can never win, because they will always be blocked by the existing S's. The second player can win by placing an O in the first empty square, and then placing an S in the second empty square. This creates a new sequence of three consecutive S's, which the first player cannot win.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case. Suppose the grid is filled with S's, except for three consecutive empty squares. The first player can never win, because they will always be blocked by the existing S's. The second player can win by placing an O in the first empty square, and then placing an S in the second empty square.

This is because the first player will always be blocked by the existing S's, and the second player can always find a way to create a new sequence of three consecutive S's.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the second player has a winning strategy. The second player can always create a new sequence of three consecutive S's, which the first player cannot win. This means that the second player can win the game, regardless of the moves made by the first player.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that the second player has a winning strategy in the Y2K Game.

If the first player writes an S in the second column, the second player can write an O in the first column, and the first player is forced to write an S in the third column.

Suppose the game is in a block position, and the first player writes an S in the first column of the second row. If the second player writes an O in the first column of the second row, the first player is forced to write an S in the second column of the second row, and the second player can write an O in the third column of the second row. This creates a new block position, where the first player is forced to write an S in the first column of the third row.\n\nIf the second player writes an O in the second column of the second row, the first player is forced to write an S in the third column of the second row, and the second player can write an O in the first column of the third row.

In this block position, the second player can always write an O in the first column of the next row, forcing the first player to write an S in the second column of the next row. This creates a new block position, where the first player is forced to write an S in the first column of the row after that.\n\nSince the game is played on a $1 \\times 2000$ grid, there are only 2000 rows.

If $n = 0$, then the board is empty, and $B_0$ is the set of all possible board positions. Since the first player can only make a move by placing an S or an O in an empty square, $B_0$ is a subset of $A_1$, which is the set of all possible board positions after the first move.\n\nNow, let's consider the inductive step.

This means that the second player has made $n+1$ moves, and the first player has made $n$ moves.\n\nSince the first player has made $n$ moves, they must have made at least one move that is not SOS. Let's call this move $m$. We can assume without loss of generality that $m$ is the first move of the first player.\n\nNow, let's consider the board position $b'$, which is obtained by removing the move $m$ from the board position $b$. This means that the second player has made $n$ moves, and the first player has made $n-1$ moves.\n\nSince $b' \\in B_n$, we know that $b' \\in A_{n+1}$. But we also know that $b' \\in A_{n+2}$, since the first player can only make a move by placing an S or an O in an empty square.\n\nTherefore, we have $b' \\in A_{n+2}$.

Therefore such a set exists.\n\nAnother way to define this set of points is let $M$ be:\n\nLet $V$ be a solid cube or right angled parallelepiped\n\nLet $M_{v}$ be the set of all 8 vertices of $V$\n\nLet $M_{me}$ be the set of all 12 midpoints of the edges of $V$\n\nLet $M_{mf}$ be the set of all 6 midpoints of the faces of $V$\n\nLet $M_{c}$ be the center of $V$\n\n$M$=$M_{v} \\cup M_{me} \\cup M_{mf} \\cup M_{c}$\n\nIt is possible that one can construct many other sets of $M$ using regular tetrahedrons with some reflections and with less points than 27, or by translating or rotating or skewing all the the points simultaneously of the finite set $M$ that we defined here.  But that is not necessary for this problem because it asks to prove whether there exist a set with the described conditions.  By showing that at least one set exists with those conditions, the problem is proved.\n\n$IMO 1973 P2 01.png$\n\n~Tomas Diaz.  orders@tomasdiaz.com\n\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Therefore, the lines $AB$ and $CD$ are never parallel and not coincident.\n\nThus, there does not exist a finite set $M$ of points in space not lying in the same plane such that, for any two points $A$ and $B$ of $M$; one can select two other points $C$ and $D$ of $M$ so that lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel and not coincident.",
      "The answer is no.\n\nTo see this, consider a set of points $M$ in 3-space, where each point is a vertex of a regular tetrahedron.  Each pair of points in $M$ is connected by a line segment.  Since the tetrahedron is regular, each line segment is either a side of the tetrahedron or a diagonal.  If two points $A$ and $B$ are connected by a side of the tetrahedron, then the line segment connecting the other two vertices of the tetrahedron (which are $C$ and $D$) is parallel to $AB$ but not coincident with it.  If two points $A$ and $B$ are connected by a diagonal, then the line segment connecting the other two vertices of the tetrahedron (which are $C$ and $D$) is not parallel to $AB$.\n\nTherefore, for any two points $A$ and $B$ in $M$, there exist points $C$ and $D$ in $M$ such that lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel and not coincident."

Let $A$ and $B$ be the vertices of the rhombus.  Let $X$ and $Y$ be the points of tangency of the circle with the diagonals.  Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $AX$ and $BY$ respectively.

Then $XQ + YP = 12$ and $x + y = 5$.  Let $OX = OY = z$.  Then $z^2 + x^2 = 25$ and $z^2 + y^2 = 144$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $x^2 - y^2 = 119$.  Factoring the left side of the equation, we get $(x+y)(x-y) = 119$.  Since $x+y = 5$, we get $5(x-y) = 119$.  Dividing both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $x-y = \\frac{119}{5}$.  Adding the equations $x+y = 5$ and $x-y = \\frac{119}{5}$, we get $2x = \\frac{119}{5} + 5$.  Dividing both sides of the equation by $2$, we get $x = \\frac{119}{10} + \\frac{5}{2}$.  Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $x = \\frac{119}{10} + \\frac{25}{10}$.  Adding the fractions on the right side of the equation, we get $x = \\frac{144}{10}$.  Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $x = \\frac{72}{5}$.  Substituting $x = \\frac{72}{5}$ into the equation $x+y = 5$, we get $\\frac{72}{5} + y = 5$.  Subtracting $\\frac{72}{5}$ from both sides of the equation, we get $y = 5 - \\frac{72}{5}$.  Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $y = \\frac{25}{5} - \\frac{72}{5}$.  Subtracting the fractions on the right side of the equation, we get $y = \\frac{-47}{5}$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are lengths, we can ignore the negative sign.  Therefore, $x = \\frac{72}{5}$ and $y = \\frac{47}{5}$.  Since $XQ = x$ and $YP = y$, we have $XQ = \\frac{72}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{47}{5}$.  Since $XQ + YP = 12$, we have $\\frac{72}{5} + \\frac{47}{5} = 12$.  Adding the fractions on the left side of the equation, we get $\\frac{119}{5} = 12$.  Multiplying both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $119 = 60$.  Since this equation is false, we have reached a contradiction.  Therefore, the assumption that $XQ = \\frac{72}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{47}{5}$ must be false.  Since $XQ$ and $YP$ are lengths, we can ignore the negative sign.  Therefore, $XQ = \\frac{72}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{47}{5}$ is false, and $XQ = \\frac{47}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{72}{5}$ is true.  Since $XQ = \\frac{47}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{72}{5}$, we have $XQ = \\frac{47}{5}$ and $YP = \\frac{72}{5}$.  Since $XQ + YP = 12$, we have $\\frac{47}{5} + \\frac{72}{5} = 12$.  Adding the fractions on the left side of the equation, we get $\\frac{119}{5} = 12$.  Multiplying both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $119 = 60$.",

In this case, the base of the triangle is $6$ and the height is $5$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(5) = 30$. Solving for $DE$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. In this case, we know that $DE$ is the hypotenuse and $DC$ and $CE$ are the legs. We can set up the equation $DE^2 = DC^2 + CE^2$. We know that $DC = 6$ and $CE = 5$, so we can substitute these values into the equation to get $DE^2 = 6^2 + 5^2$. Solving for $DE$, we get $DE = \\sqrt{6^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{61}$. However, we can simplify this expression by noticing that $61$ is a perfect square. We can rewrite $61$ as $61 = 6^2 + 5^2 = 11^2$, so we can simplify the expression to get $DE = \\sqrt{11^2} = 11$. However, this is not an option. We can try another method. We can use the fact that the area of the triangle is equal to the area of the rectangle. We can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(DE)(5) = 30$. Solving for $DE$, we get $DE = \\frac{2(30)}{5} = 12$. Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
      "We can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. In this case, the bases are $AD$ and $DE$, and the height is $DC$. We can also use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base is $DC$ and the height is $CE$. Since the areas are equal, we can set up the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)=\\frac{1}{2}bh$. We can simplify this equation to $h(b_1+b_2)=bh$. We can also substitute $DC$ for $h$ and $CE$ for $b$. This gives us the equation $DC(AD+DE)=CE\\cdot DC$. We can cancel out $DC$ on both sides of the equation, giving us $AD+DE=CE$. We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $CE$. Since $CE$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $DC$ and $DE$, we have $CE=\\sqrt{DC^2+DE^2}$. We can substitute $DC=5$ and $DE=x$ into this equation, giving us $CE=\\sqrt{5^2+x^2}=\\sqrt{25+x^2}$. We can now substitute this expression for $CE$ into the equation $AD+DE=CE$. We know that $AD=6$, so we have $6+x=CE=\\sqrt{25+x^2}$. We can square both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root, giving us $(6+x)^2=25+x^2$. We can expand the left-hand side of this equation to get $36+12x+x^2=25+x^2$. We can subtract $x^2$ from both sides of this equation to get $36+12x=25$. We can subtract $25$ from both sides of this equation to get $11+12x=0$. We can subtract $11$ from both sides of this equation to get $12x=-11$. We can divide both sides of this equation by $12$ to get $x=-\\frac{11}{12}$. However, we know that $DE$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution. We can try another approach. We can use the fact that the areas of the rectangle and the triangle are equal. The area of the rectangle is $AD\\cdot DC=6\\cdot 5=30$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}DC\\cdot CE=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot CE$. Since the areas are equal, we can set up the equation: $AD\\cdot DC=\\frac{1}{2}DC\\cdot CE$. We can simplify this equation to $AD=CE$. We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $CE$. Since $CE$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $DC$ and $DE$, we have $CE=\\sqrt{DC^2+DE^2}$. We can substitute $DC=5$ and $DE=x$ into this equation, giving us $CE=\\sqrt{5^2+x^2}=\\sqrt{25+x^2}$. We can now substitute this expression for $CE$ into the equation $AD=CE$. We know that $AD=6$, so we have $6=CE=\\sqrt{25+x^2}$. We can square both sides of this equation to get rid of the square root, giving us $6^2=25+x^2$. We can expand the left-hand side of this equation to get $36=25+x^2$. We can subtract $25$ from both sides of this equation to get $11=x^2$. We can take the square root of both sides of this equation to get $x=\\pm\\sqrt{11}$. However, we know that $DE$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution. We can try another approach. We can use the fact that the areas of the rectangle and the triangle are equal. The area of the rectangle is $AD\\cdot DC=6\\cdot 5=30$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}DC\\cdot CE=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot CE$. Since the areas are equal, we can set up the equation: $AD\\cdot DC",

The first way is the most obvious, and that is to multiply the base times the height ($16\\cdot15$) and then divide it by two. The second way is, in a way, a little more complex. Note that $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle BCD$ are congruent. This means that if we find the area of one triangle, we can just multiply it's area by 2 and we've found the area of the larger triangle $ABC$. But since we always divide by two, as it is in the formula for finding the area of a triangle, the multiply by two and divide by two cancel out, giving us that if we just multiply base times height of $\\triangle ACD$, we will get the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nNow you might think: \"But what is the other way of finding the area\". Well that is $AC$, which would be the base, times $DE$, the radius, which would be the height.\n\nThe first way to find the area gives us the area of the $\\triangle ABC$, $\\frac{15\\cdot16}{2}=120$. This gives us $120=AC\\cdot r$ ($r$ signifies radius). We can find $AC$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ACD$. The two legs are $8$ and $15$, which gives us that the hypotenuse, $AC$, is equal to $17$.\n\nNow that we have an equation with only one variable for the radius, $120=17r$, we can just solve for the radius. We get $r=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{120}{17}}$.\n\nThis may seem like a lengthy explanation, but doing it yourself when you know what to do, it actually takes very little time. Try it yourself!"

We can draw a perpendicular line from the center of the semicircle to the base of the triangle. This line will bisect the base of the triangle, so the length of the base of the triangle is $8$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the perpendicular line:\n\n$$r^2 + 8^2 = (15)^2$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$r^2 + 64 = 225$$\n\nSubtracting $64$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$r^2 = 161$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{161}$$\n\nHowever, we can simplify $\\sqrt{161}$ by factoring it into $\\sqrt{161} = \\sqrt{7\\cdot23} = \\sqrt{7}\\cdot\\sqrt{23}$.

      "We have that $12^2 \\le x < 13^2$, so $144 \\le x < 169$.  We also have that $120^2 \\le 100x < 121^2$, so $14400 \\le 100x < 14641$.  We can divide by 100 to get $144 \\le x < 146.41$.  We can see that the only values of $x$ that satisfy both of these inequalities are $144 \\le x < 146.41$.  The length of this interval is $146.41-144=2.41$.  The length of the entire interval is $200-100=100$.  Therefore, the probability that $\\lfloor {\\sqrt{100x}} \\rfloor = 120$ is $\\frac{2.41}{100} = \\frac{241}{10000} = \\frac{241}{2500}$.",
      "We have that $12^2 < x < 13^2$, so $x \\in [144, 169]$.  We want to find the probability that $120 < \\sqrt{100x} < 121$, which is equivalent to $120^2 < 100x < 121^2$.  We have that $120^2 < 100x < 121^2$ is equivalent to $14400 < 100x < 14641$, which is equivalent to $144 < x < 146.41$.  Therefore, the probability that $\\lfloor {\\sqrt{100x}} \\rfloor = 120$ is the probability that $x \\in [144, 146.41]$, which is $\\frac{146.41 - 144}{169 - 144} = \\frac{2.41}{25} = \\boxed{\\text{(A)} \\ \\frac{2}{25}}$."
